      "title": "The Unrelenting Pundit-Led Effort to Delegitimize All Negative Reporting About Hillary Clinton",
      "content": "In his New York Times column yesterday, Paul Krugman did something that he made clear he regarded as quite brave: He defended the Democratic Party presidential nominee and likely next U.S. president from journalistic investigations. Complaining about media bias, Krugman claimed that journalists are driven by \u201cthe presumption that anything Hillary Clinton does must be corrupt, most spectacularly illustrated by the increasingly bizarre coverage of the Clinton Foundation.\u201d While generously acknowledging that it was legitimate to take a look at the billions of dollars raised by the Clintons as Hillary pursued increasing levels of political power \u2014 vast sums often received from the very parties most vested in her decisions as a public official \u2014 it is now \u201cvery clear,\u201d he proclaimed, that there was absolutely nothing improper about any of what she or her husband did.\nKrugman\u2019s column, chiding the media for its unfairly negative coverage of his beloved candidate, was, predictably, a big hit among Democrats \u2014 not just because of their agreement with its content but because of what they regarded as the remarkable courage required to publicly defend someone as marginalized and besieged as the former first lady, two-term New York senator, secretary of state, and current establishment-backed multimillionaire presidential front-runner. Krugman \u2014 in a tweet proclamation that has now been re-tweeted more than 10,000 times \u2014 heralded himself this way: \u201cI was reluctant to write today\u2019s column because I knew journos would hate it. But it felt like a moral duty.\u201d\nTrue fact: I was reluctant to write today's col because I knew journos would hate it. But it felt like a moral duty https://t.co/ldee224frl\n\u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) September 5, 2016\nAs my colleague Zaid Jilani remarked: \u201cI can imagine Paul Krugman standing in front of the mirror saying, \u2018This is *your Tahrir Square* big guy.\u2019\u201d Nate Silver, early yesterday morning, even suggested that Krugman\u2019s Clinton-defending column was so edgy and threatening that the New York Times \u2014 which published the column \u2014 was effectively suppressing Krugman\u2019s brave stance by refusing to promote it on Twitter (the NYT tweeted Krugman\u2019s column a few hours later, early in the afternoon). Thankfully, it appears that Krugman \u2014 at least thus far \u2014 has suffered no governmental recriminations or legal threats, nor any career penalties, for his intrepid, highly risky defense of Hillary Clinton.\nThat\u2019s because \u2014 in contrast to his actually brave, orthodoxy-defying work in 2002 as one of the few media voices opposed to the invasion of Iraq, for which he deserves eternal credit \u2014 Krugman here is doing little more than echoing conventional media wisdom. That prominent journalists are overwhelmingly opposed to Donald Trump is barely debatable; their collective contempt for him is essentially out in the open, which is where it should be. Contrary to Krugman\u2019s purported expectation, countless Clinton-supporting journalists rushed to express praise for Krugman. Indeed, with very few exceptions, U.S. elites across the board \u2014 from both parties, spanning multiple ideologies \u2014 are aligned with unprecedented unity against Donald Trump. The last thing required to denounce him, or to defend Hillary Clinton, is bravery.\nThat wasn\u2019t true at first: For a long time, journalists refused to take the dangers posed by Trump\u2019s campaign seriously. In March 2016, I wrote a column denouncing the U.S. media for venerating feigned neutrality over its responsibility to sound the alarm about how extremist and menacing Trump\u2019s candidacy really is. But in the last few months, Trump\u2019s media portrayal has been overwhelmingly (and justifiably) negative; his shady business scams have been endlessly investigated and dissected (often on the front page of the NYT); he and his surrogates are subjected to remarkably (and fairly) harsh interviews; his pathological lying has been unequivocally chronicled by numerous media outlets; and few journalists have suppressed their horror at his most extremist policies. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Tom Gara put it last month: \u201cMy Twitter timeline is now just a continuous rolling denunciation of Donald Trump.\u201d\nNew gold standard for TV news: Fact-checking Trump while he speaks. @CNN pic.twitter.com/kFCac0rjHD\n\u2014 Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) June 2, 2016\nThat American journalists have dispensed with muted tones and fake neutrality when reporting on Trump is a positive development. He and his rhetoric pose genuine threats, and the U.S. media would be irresponsible if it failed to make that clear. But aggressive investigative journalism against Trump is not enough for Democratic partisans whose voice is dominant in U.S. media discourse. They also want a cessation of any news coverage that reflects negatively on Hillary Clinton. Most, of course, won\u2019t say this explicitly (though some do), but \u2014 as the wildly adored Krugman column from yesterday reflects \u2014 they will just reflexively dismiss any such coverage as illegitimate and invalid.\nIt should be the opposite of surprising, or revealing, that pundits loyally devoted to a particular candidate dislike all reporting that reflects negatively on that candidate. There is probably no more die-hard Clinton loyalist in the U.S. media than Paul Krugman. He has used his column for years to defend her and attack any of her critics. Indeed, in 2008, he was the first to observe that \u2014 in his words \u2014 \u201cthe Obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality,\u201d comparing the adulation Clinton\u2019s 2008 primary opponent was receiving to the swooning over George W. Bush\u2019s flight suit. He spent the 2016 primary maligning Sanders supporters as unstable, unserious losers (the straight, white, male columnist also regularly referred to them \u2014 including female and LGBT Sanders supporters \u2014 as \u201cbros\u201d). And now he\u2019s assigned himself the role as Arbiter of Proper Journalism, and \u2014 along with virtually all other Clinton-supporting pundits and journalists \u2014 has oh-so-surprisingly ruled that all journalism that reflects poorly on Hillary Clinton is unsubstantiated, biased, and deceitful.\nThe absolute last metric journalists should use for determining what to cover is the reaction of pundits who, like Krugman and plenty of others, are singularly devoted to the election of one of the candidates. Of course Hillary Clinton\u2019s die-hard loyalists in the media will dislike, and find invalid, any suggestion that she engaged in any sort of questionable conduct. Their self-assigned role is to defend her from all criticisms. They view themselves more as campaign operatives than journalists: Their principal, overriding goal is to ensure that Clinton wins the election. They will obviously hate anything \u2014 particularly negative reporting about her \u2014 that conflicts with that goal. They will jettison even their core stated beliefs \u2014 such as the view that big-money donations corrupt politicians \u2014 in order to fulfill that goal.\nBut it would be journalistic malpractice of the highest order if the billions of dollars received by the Clintons \u2014 both personally and though their various entities \u2014 were not rigorously scrutinized and exposed in detail by reporters. That\u2019s exactly what they ought to be doing. The fact that quid pro quos cannot be definitively proven does not remotely negate the urgency of this journalism. That\u2019s because quid pro quos by their nature elude such proof (can anyone prove that Republicans steadfastly support Israel and low taxes because of the millions they get from Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers, or that the Florida attorney general decided not to prosecute Trump because his foundation and his daughter donated to her?). Beyond quid quo pros, the Clintons\u2019 constant, pioneering merger of massive private wealth and political power and influence is itself highly problematic. Nobody forced them to take millions of dollars from the Saudis and Goldman Sachs tycoons and corporations with vested interests in the State Department; having chosen to do so with great personal benefit, they are now confronting the consequences in how the public views such behavior.\nThat Donald Trump is an uber-nationalist, bigotry-exploiting demagogue and unstable extremist does not remotely entitle Hillary Clinton to waltz into the Oval Office free of aggressive journalistic scrutiny. Nor does Trump\u2019s extremism constitute a defense to anything that she\u2019s done. It is absolutely true that Trump has at least as many troublesome financial transactions and entangling relationships as the Clintons do: These donations to the Florida attorney general are among the most corrupt-appearing transactions yet documented. Even worse, Trump has shielded himself from much needed scrutiny by inexcusably refusing to release his tax returns, while much of the reporting about the Clintons is possible only because they have released theirs. All of that is important and should be highlighted.\nBut none of it suggests that anything other than a bright journalistic light is appropriate for examining the Clintons\u2019 conduct. Yet there are prominent pundits and journalists who literally denounce every critical report about Clinton as unfair and deceitful, and band together to malign the reporters who scrutinize the Clintons\u2019 financial transactions. Those prominent voices combine with the million-dollar online army that supreme sleaze merchant David Brock has assembled to attack Clinton critics; as the Los Angeles Times reported in May: \u201cClinton\u2019s well-heeled backers have opened a new frontier in digital campaigning, one that seems to have been inspired by some of the internet\u2019s worst instincts. Correct the Record, a Super PAC coordinating with Clinton\u2019s campaign, is spending some $1 million to find and confront social media users who post unflattering messages about the Democratic front-runner.\u201d\nAll of this means that any journalists reporting negatively on Clinton are instantly and widely bombarded with criticisms denouncing their work as illegitimate, as they\u2019ve started noting:\nClinton backers' shaming of the press for reporting anything the Clinton campaign dislikes is rapidly approaching self-parody territory.\n\u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 4, 2016\nhttps://twitter.com/jbarro/status/770948798667452417\nNo one in the media should do another story remotely questioning anything Hillary has done until the NYT accuses Trump of bribery on Page 1.\n\u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 6, 2016\nSo little upset here at Clintons for decisions like taking $18 million from for-profit college. Only upset at press for daring to point out.\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) September 6, 2016\nOr just look at the outrage directed last night at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman \u2014 who has written story after story investigating Donald Trump \u2014 for the crime of innocuously noting a Washington Post story about Bill Clinton\u2019s multimillion-dollar payday for a largely no-show job from a for-profit college:\nWell-reported deep dive into @billclinton multi-million-dollar honorary chancellor role with Laureate https://t.co/EHNrVnv89i\n\u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 6, 2016\nIt\u2019s very common for political factions to believe that they\u2019re persecuted and victimized. Even with the overwhelming bulk of the national media so openly aligned against Trump \u2014 with an endless array of investigative stories showing Trump to be an unscrupulous con artist and pathological liar \u2014 Clinton supporters seem to genuinely believe that the media is actually biased against their candidate.\nThe reality is that large, pro-Clinton liberal media platforms \u2014 such as Vox, and the Huffington Post, and prime-time MSNBC programs, and the columnists and editorialists of the New York Times and the Washington Post, and most major New York-based weekly magazines \u2014 have been openly campaigning for Hillary Clinton. I don\u2019t personally see anything wrong with that \u2014 I\u2019m glad when journalists shed their faux objectivity; I believe the danger of Trump\u2019s candidacy warrants that; and I hope this candor continues past the November election \u2014 but the everyone-is-against-us self-pity from Clinton partisans is just a joke. They are the dominant voices in elite media discourse, and it\u2019s a big reason why Clinton is highly likely to win.\nThat\u2019s all the more reason why journalists should be subjecting Clinton\u2019s financial relationships, associations, and secret communications to as much scrutiny as Donald Trump\u2019s. That certainly does not mean that journalists should treat their various sins and transgressions as equivalent: Nothing in the campaign compares to Trump\u2019s deport-11-million-people or ban-all-Muslim policies, or his attacks on a judge for his Mexican ethnicity, etc. But this emerging narrative that Clinton should not only enjoy the support of a virtually united elite class but also a scrutiny-free march into the White House is itself quite dangerous. Clinton partisans in the media \u2014 including those who regard themselves as journalists \u2014 will continue to reflexively attack all reporting that reflects negatively on her, but that reporting should nonetheless continue with unrestrained aggression.",

      "title": "White House Report Concludes That Bite-Mark Analysis Is Junk Science",
      "content": "The President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has concluded that forensic bite-mark evidence is not scientifically valid and is unlikely ever to be validated, according to a draft report obtained by The Intercept. The report, titled \u201cForensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods,\u201d is marked as a \u201cpredecisional\u201d draft created August 26 that is not to be quoted or distributed, though the title page suggests the report will be made public sometime this month.\nThe report reviews a handful of common forensic practices, so called feature-comparison disciplines, or pattern-matching practices \u2014 bite-mark analysis, fingerprint and firearm analysis, shoe tread analysis, and DNA mixture analysis \u2014 each of which involves an \u201cexpert\u201d looking at a piece of evidence and eyeballing whether it matches a particular image, person, or object. The report discusses whether each practice has been scientifically validated, what it would take to do so, and how each practice should be used in the courtroom \u2014 if at all.\nIn the case of bite-mark evidence, the report is especially critical. \u201cPCAST finds that bitemark analysis does not meet the scientific standards for foundational validity, and is far from meeting such standards,\u201d it reads. \u201cTo the contrary, available scientific evidence strongly suggests that examiners cannot consistently agree on whether an injury is a human bitemark and cannot identify the source of [a] bitemark with reasonable accuracy.\u201d\nBite-mark analysis is conducted by forensic dentists and relies on two foundational premises: first, that human dentition is unique \u2014 as unique as DNA \u2014 and second, that human skin (or another malleable substrate) is a suitable medium on which to record such an impression. The problem is that neither premise has been proved. Nonetheless, bite-mark analysis has been used in criminal cases to match individuals to alleged bites since the 1950s, when Texas\u2019s highest criminal court cleared the way for its use (in that case, a dentist claimed that a bite mark left in a piece of cheese found at the scene of a grocery burglary matched the teeth of a particular man).\nAlthough bite-mark matching is nowhere near as ubiquitous as, say, fingerprint analysis in the criminal justice system, it has left a string of victims in its wake. To date, 25 wrongful arrests or convictions have been linked to bite-mark analysis and additional cases are still pending in the courts, according to the Innocence Project. In June, Bill Richards was freed from prison after spending nearly 23 years behind bars for the murder of his wife in California based on the erroneous testimony of a forensic dentist who said a wound found on his wife Pamela\u2019s hand was a match to Richards\u2019s supposedly unusual dentition.\nDespite their poor track record, many forensic dentists \u2014 most associated with the American Board of Forensic Odontology, the discipline\u2019s certifying body \u2014 have remained rabidly defensive of their practice and the notion that it is a righteous undertaking that helps put criminals behind bars. An integral part of their defense has been to lash out at critics \u2014even those among their own ranks. The group unsuccessfully tried to expel Dr. C. Michael Bowers from the American Academy of Forensic Sciences \u2014 the nation\u2019s preeminent umbrella organization for forensic practitioners \u2014 on a trumped-up ethics charge. And they have attacked both professionally and personally Dr. Mary Bush and her husband, Peter, who have conducted significant research demonstrating the practice\u2019s lack of a scientific underpinning. Notably, the PCAST report gives a distinct nod to the Bushes\u2019 work in determining that there is no actual science behind bite-mark analysis.\nWhile the report acknowledges the dentists\u2019 concern that excluding bite-mark evidence \u201ccould hamper efforts to convict criminals in some cases,\u201d it rejects the idea that this alone is sufficient to warrant the practice. If the dentists\u2019 concerns are valid, \u201cthe correct solution, from a scientific perspective, would not be to admit expert testimony based on invalid and unreliable methods, but rather to attempt to develop scientifically valid methods,\u201d it reads. \u201cHowever, PCAST considers the prospects of developing bitemark analysis into a scientifically valid method to be low. We advise against devoting significant resources to such efforts.\u201d\nPattern Matching, Subjectivity, and Junk Science\nPresident Obama created the advisory council in 2009 as a means of gathering scientific input that could impact policy decisions. Although the practice of presidents naming scientific advisers dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, the timing of the creation of Obama\u2019s council was particularly notable, coming just roughly two months after the release of a groundbreaking report from the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council, which cast a long shadow over a host of pattern-matching forensic disciplines that have been used for decades in criminal cases. That report \u2014 \u201cStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward\u201d \u2014 noted a lack of scientific underpinning in nearly every forensic practice, except for DNA, and called for research to be done to shore up the disciplines.\nIn the wake of the NAS report, the government has taken action \u2014 a National Commission on Forensic Science was created, and a number of scientific working groups have undertaken the arduous task of coordinating the development of standards and guidelines for various forensic disciplines. PCAST was asked by Obama in September 2015 to see what additional efforts might be undertaken to aid the effort to instill science into forensics. Upon review, PCAST concluded \u201cthat the most useful contribution it could make would be to add clarity on the scientific meaning of \u2018reliable principles and methods\u2019 and \u2018scientific validity\u2019 in the context of certain forensic disciplines.\u201d\nScientific validity and reliability mandate that each method be subjected to empirical testing in order to determine meaningful error rates. \u201cWithout appropriate estimates of accuracy, an examiner\u2019s statement that two samples are similar \u2014 or even indistinguishable \u2014 is scientifically meaningless: it has no probative value and considerable potential for prejudicial impact,\u201d reads the report. \u201cNothing \u2014 not training, personal experience nor professional practices \u2014 can substitute for adequate empirical demonstration of accuracy.\u201d\nTo be fair, bite-mark analysis is not the only practice criticized by PCAST. Fingerprint matching has only recently been put to rigorous testing (it is \u201cdistressing\u201d that it has taken so long to do so, the report notes), and two such studies produced high error rates \u2014 in one, an error rate of 1 in 18 was found, in the other 1 in 306. The report recommends that jurors be informed of the studies and their results.\nWhere firearm analysis is concerned, the group notes early studies indicate that examiners can, \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d connect spent ammunition to the gun from which it was fired, but also reports that just one appropriate study has so far been conducted and that other \u201cfrequently cited studies seriously underestimate the false positive rate.\u201d Importantly, for both fingerprints and firearms analysis, the group writes that transforming the practice from a subjective one to an objective one is preferable, by automating the disciplines through \u201cmachine learning\u201d image analysis.\nRegarding footwear analysis \u2014 matching a shoe tread pattern left at a crime scene to a particular shoe based on \u201crandomly acquired characteristics,\u201d such as cuts and gouges on a shoe\u2019s sole \u2014 the PCAST finds that there are no studies that demonstrate the practice is based on actual science. \u201cSuch conclusions are unsupported by any meaningful evidence or estimates of their accuracy and thus are not scientifically valid.\u201d\nAnd while PCAST finds that single-source and simple mixture DNA analysis rests firmly on a scientific foundation, the analysis of complex mixtures requires more validation. Complex mixtures involve DNA samples with two or more unknown sources and result in a profile that \u201csuperimposes multiple individual DNA profiles.\u201d In such cases, an analyst has to visually inspect the results and make a subjective determination about whether a particular suspect is present in the sample. And that determination can become clouded by outside knowledge of the particular case at hand, the report notes. The creation of \u201cprobabilistic genotyping software\u201d and the testing of such software would go a long way to curing the problem. (The PCAST report notes that there are problems associated with other forensic practices it has not reviewed \u2014 singling out cases of alleged arson and prosecutions based on shaken baby syndrome \u2014 that also \u201crequire urgent attention.\u201d)\nPredictably, reaction to the draft report by the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) was swift. On September 2 \u2014 the day after the PCAST reportedly voted to approve it \u2014 the group issued a press release blasting the PCAST \u2014 and, seemingly missing the point the PCAST is trying to make. \u201cThe forensic disciplines that the PCAST authors attack are (and have been) reliably used every day by investigators, prosecutors, and defense attorneys across the United States to aid in both exonerating the innocent and convicting the guilty,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe PCAST position regarding the use of forensic science is scientifically irresponsible. Adopting any of their recommendations would have a devastating effect on the ability of law enforcement, prosecutors and the defense bar to fully investigate their cases, exclude innocent suspects, implicate the guilty and achieve true justice at trial.\u201d\nNDAA president Mike Ramos, the elected district attorney in San Bernardino County, California, said that the NDAA will \u201ccontinue to serve the citizens of this great nation\u201d in part by defending the criminal justice system \u201cagainst those who would seek to undermine\u201d it.\nNotably, it was under Ramos\u2019s leadership that Bill Richards was wrongfully convicted of his wife\u2019s murder; his office tried Richards three times before finally getting a conviction, and did so only after the questionable bite-mark evidence was introduced. After the California Supreme Court in late May threw out that conviction, which it determined was based on junk science, Ramos\u2019s office made it clear to defense attorneys that they would seek to try Richards again. Ultimately, Ramos\u2019s office dismissed the case, and Richards was finally freed.\n\u201cAs a man who lost his life behind the false science of bite marks, I feel the proposed action of eliminating its use in the courtroom is long overdue,\u201d Richards wrote in an email to The Intercept. \u201cThe desire to \u2026 convict appears to blind experts who don\u2019t consider that some defendants are innocent. No subjective \u2018science\u2019 should be used in any courtroom. The witch hunt mentality takes over and they find matches that are not there, sending innocent people to prison.\u201d",

      "content": "I\u2019m going to have a story published later today about a new document, but until then, this new interview with (and profile of) Director of National Intelligence James Clapper by the Daily Beast\u2018s Eli Lake is worth spending a few moments examining. Last week, Lake published one excerpt of his interview where Clapper admitted that the U.S. Government should have told the American people that the NSA was collecting their communications records: as pure a vindication of Edward Snowden\u2019s choice as it gets, for obvious reasons. But there are several new, noteworthy revelations from this morning\u2019s article:\nThanks to rogue contractor Edward Snowden, the machinations of the shadow bureaucracy Clapper heads have for the last eight months been exposed one news story at a time. Clapper is often the guy who has to call newspaper editors to tell them not to print stories that they usually publish anyway.\nThis process of pre-publication notice to the government of NSA stories has been wildly misreported in some places. I\u2019ve long expressed contempt for this process where it results in the suppression of information that should be public; where it essentially elevates U.S. officials into publication partners by engaging in protracted \u201cnegotiations\u201d with them over what can and cannot be published; and especially where it means news organizations knowingly allow government officials to lie by withholding the actual facts.\nFor all the NSA stories published over the last eight months all around the world, the U.S. government was notified prior to publication (usually very shortly prior) by the news organizations\u2019 editors (never, to my knowledge, by the journalists, at least not by me). News organizations do this for two reasons.\nThe first is legal: the U.S. Government insists that the publication of classified information, especially that which relates to \u201ccommunications intelligence\u201d, is a felony (see 18 U.S \u00a7 798), so every media lawyer vehemently argues that allowing the government an opportunity to make the case for why something shouldn\u2019t be published is necessary to show a lack of criminal intent, i.e., to avoid criminal prosecution even while publishing top secret documents; the other is journalistic: it makes sense that journalists making choices about what to publish and what to say about documents would want more, rather than less, information when deciding.\nI can\u2019t speak for what The Washington Post or New York Times have done, but for the NSA articles on which I\u2019ve worked \u2013 at the Guardian and with more than a dozen media outlets around the world \u2013 the government has argued in most cases that the story and accompanying documents should not be published. And in almost every single case \u2013 99% if not more \u2013 those arguments have been rejected in their entirety and the stories and documents were published anyway. In fact, for the dozens and dozens of stories and documents on which I\u2019ve worked, I can only recall a single case where anything the government said resulted in anything being withheld that we had decided to publish, and that was a trivial aspect of one part of one document which, unbeknownst to us, could have revealed the identity of an NSA employee (the Guardian and New York Times, without my involvement, both withheld some details on their story about NSA/GCHQ compromising of encryption standards, though primarily \u2013 as I understand it \u2013 because publishing the handful of compromised standards we knew about would mislead people into believing the other compromised standards (the vast majority of which weren\u2019t revealed by the documents) were safe).\nIn every single other case, the government\u2019s arguments for non-publication were rejected, usually because they were vague and unpersuasive. So while it\u2019s true that the government\u2019s input has been permitted prior to publication \u2013 just as journalists seek the input of anyone about which they\u2019re writing \u2013 Lake is correct that in most cases (in my experience, almost all) that official input demanding suppression was rejected, exactly as it should have been.\nTo this day the U.S. government doesn\u2019t know the full extent of what Snowden revealed or whether more documents that have yet to be published in the press have made their way into the hands of Russian or Chinese intelligence agencies.\nIt\u2019s been rather amazing to watch not only the standard roster of government-loyal American journalists, but also those who fancy themselves some sort of cynical critics, uncritically regurgitate the government\u2019s evidence-free assertion that Snowden took and then gave to journalists 1.7 million documents. It amazes me because: (1) anyone at this point who is willing to equate evidence-free government assertions with Truth is drowning in some extreme levels of authoritarianism, by definition; and (2) the government clearly has no idea what Snowden took, as report after report has made crystal clear.\nCovering nearly an entire wall of the waiting area outside Clapper\u2019s office is a wooden relief sculpture dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. It contains a flag, a rendition of the constitutional assembly, and a copy of the document itself. It also has a plaque that reads, \u201cWhat is the magic of the Constitution? The magic is how it states: We, the people. For the first time in history, government was about the people, not about the leader.\u201d\nYes, that\u2019s right: James Clapper has converted the wall outside of his office into a flamboyant homage to the very same U.S. Constitution that he vandalizes on a daily basis. That is the greatest act of either deliberately overt contempt for the public or pathological self-delusion since Barack Obama advocated a legalized system of \u201cpreventive detention\u201d in 2009 while he stood in front of the U.S. Constitution at the National Archive. Someone may want to explain to Clapper that a primary impetus for that Constitution, and for the American Revolution generally, was hatred of the King\u2019s \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d whereby people could be subject to searches without a whiff of evidence of wrongdoing.\nClapper also acknowledges that the very human nature of the bureaucracy he controls virtually insures that more mass disclosures are inevitable. \u201cIn the end,\u201d he says, \u201cwe will never ever be able to guarantee that there will not be an Edward Snowden or another Chelsea Manning because this is a large enterprise composed of human beings with all their idiosyncrasies.\u201d\nThat is indeed true, and it\u2019s good news: more Chelsea Mannings and Edward Snowdens are inevitable, and there is nothing the U.S. Government can do to stop them. That\u2019s good news because it means government officials will have to operate on the assumption that what they do in the dark will become public (an excellent deterrent) and because that type of transparency is inherently healthy in a political culture where secrecy is rampant and the institutions designed to check it (Congress, the media, the federal judiciary) have all profoundly failed.\nThis also underscores why the U.S. Government has been so vindictive in trying to punish the likes of Manning and other whistleblowers. Since they have no means of preventing these sorts of leaks, their only hope is to create a climate of fear and intimidation: if you are thinking about exposing our bad acts, look at what we did to Chelsea Manning or Tom Drake and think twice. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been so vital \u2013 and, for the U.S. national security state, so devastating \u2013 that Edward Snowden has remained out of their grasp: rather than getting to parade him in front of the world in an orange jumpsuit and shackles, U.S. officials are forced to watch as he is hailed as an international hero, receives award after award, and participates freely in the debate he triggered. That, in turn, allows the template he used to be a positive one, one that will undoubtedly inspire future whistleblowers.\n[Democratic Sen. Ron] Wyden in a statement told The Daily Beast, \u201cIt\u2019s true that no one knows what is going through a witness\u2019s head when they are sitting at the witness table, other than the witness himself. Unfortunately, over the past several years a number of senior officials have repeatedly made misleading and inaccurate statements about domestic surveillance at congressional hearings and in other public settings.\u201d\nThe lie Clapper criminally told to the U.S. Senate in March, 2013 has received the bulk of attention, but as Wyden makes clear, NSA and other senior officials have been repeatedly lying about U.S. surveillance to the Congress, to courts, and in public over and over about all sorts of things. That\u2019s what makes the slavish equating by the U.S. media of \u201cunproven NSA claims\u201d with \u201ctruth\u201d so embarrassingly subservient and irrational. It\u2019s also what makes the eagerness of American journalists to demand Snowden\u2019s imprisonment \u2013 contrasted with their fear of doing the same for Clapper \u2013 such a powerful illustration of their true allegiances and function.\nOthers are less charitable. Last month Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian Republican from Kentucky, said if Snowden was to face justice, he should \u201cshare a jail cell with James Clapper\u201d for lying to Congress.\n\u201cWell Senator Paul says I should get to know [Snowden] by being in the same prison cell with him, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea,\u201d Clapper told The Daily Beast last week. \u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t be in Mr. Snowden\u2019s best interest.\u201d\nThis statement \u2013 half creepy prison fantasy and half threat \u2013 is unsurprising. The need for U.S. officials to publicly express a desire for violence when it comes to Snowden has asserted itself over and over.\nRecall how House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers and former CIA/NSA chief Mike Hayden \u201cjoked\u201d at a hearing that Snowden should be put on the U.S. government\u2019s \u201chit list\u201d and murdered. Last month, BuzzFeed quoted several anonymous Pentagon and intelligence community officials as they laid out their fantasies for how they would like to murder Snowden (\u201cGoing back to his flat and he is casually poked by a passerby. He thinks nothing of it at the time starts to feel a little woozy and thinks it\u2019s a parasite from the local water. He goes home very innocently and next thing you know he dies in the shower\u201d). Former CIA chief James Woolsey said \u201che should be hanged by his neck until he is dead\u201d if convicted of treason, while former UN Ambassador John Bolton revealed an even more detailed fantasy: \u201cMy view is that Snowden committed treason, he ought to be convicted of that, and then he ought to swing from a tall oak tree.\u201d\nNot only does this underscore the warped pathologies among the glorious leaders of America\u2019s National Security State, but it also highlights the inanity of believing that these kinds of people can and should be trusted with invasive spying powers to be exercised in the dark.\nThe charges against his integrity bother Clapper. \u201cI would rather not hear that or see that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough on my family, I will tell you that. My son is a high school teacher and he has a tendency, or he is getting over it, to internalize a lot of this.\u201d Those who know and have worked with Clapper also say it\u2019s unfair to call him dishonest. Rhodes said President Obama values Clapper because \u201che\u2019s a straight shooter who doesn\u2019t put any spin on the ball.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that President Obama regards a proven liar as a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d. That\u2019s the same President who regards torture-and-rendition-advocating John Brennan as his high moral priest when deciding who should be put on his \u201ckill list\u201d.\nBut what\u2019s remarkable here is the self-pity on display from Clapper. He\u2019s gone around the country over the last month branding journalists as \u201caccomplices\u201d for the crime of reporting on the NSA without the slightest regard for the effects that this thuggish behavior has on those journalists, their families, and the news-gathering process.\nBut what\u2019s even more amazing is that Clapper considers himself some sort of victim rather than what he is: the completely undeserving beneficiary of a system of \u201cjustice\u201d in which ordinary and powerless people are imprisoned for trivial offenses at greater numbers than any other nation in the world, while those who wield political power, like him, are free to commit crimes without even losing their powerful jobs, let alone being prosecuted for them. James Clapper should look in the mirror every morning and be extremely grateful for the corrupted political system that has shielded him from the consequences of his crimes even as he tries to criminalize others for doing things that the U.S. Constitution guarantees them the right to do.\nInstead, he sees himself as the victim. He has medals on his chest and an important national security state position. It is simply outrageous that some people suggest that he has no right to commit felonies, and it\u2019s infuriating that his adult son has to hear some people (almost none in the media) suggest that his criminal conduct should have the same consequences as when ordinary citizens commit less serious crimes. That\u2019s the refusal to accept any personal responsibility, the view of powerful U.S. officials that they are and must be entirely above the law, the obsessive self-regard, that more than anything else has destroyed Washington\u2019s political culture.\n* * * * * *\nYesterday, the German paper Bild am Sonntag reported that after President Obama ordered the NSA to cease its eavesdropping on the communications of Chancellor Angela Merkel, they responded by increasing their surveillance of her closest ministers and advisers. Aside from providing yet another illustration of the out-of-control entitlement that drives the U.S. Surveillance State, note that the report is based on \u201ca high-ranking NSA employee in Germany\u201d, which means that this is yet another NSA source to come forward to disclose the agency\u2019s once-secret acts.",
