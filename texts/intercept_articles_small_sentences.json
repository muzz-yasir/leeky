      "content": "In his New York Times column yesterday, Paul Krugman did something that he made clear he regarded as quite brave: He defended the Democratic Party presidential nominee and likely next U.S. president from journalistic investigations. Complaining about media bias, Krugman claimed that journalists are driven by \u201cthe presumption that anything Hillary Clinton does must be corrupt, most spectacularly illustrated by the increasingly bizarre coverage of the Clinton Foundation.",

      "content": "The President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has concluded that forensic bite-mark evidence is not scientifically valid and is unlikely ever to be validated, according to a draft report obtained by The Intercept. The report, titled \u201cForensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods,\u201d is marked as a \u201cpredecisional\u201d draft created August 26 that is not to be quoted or distributed, though the title page suggests the report will be made public sometime this month.\nThe report reviews a handful of common forensic practices, so called feature-comparison disciplines, or pattern-matching practices \u2014 bite-mark analysis, fingerprint and firearm analysis, shoe tread analysis, and DNA mixture analysis \u2014 each of which involves an \u201cexpert\u201d looking at a piece of evidence and eyeballing whether it matches a particular image, person, or object.",

      "content": "I\u2019m going to have a story published later today about a new document, but until then, this new interview with (and profile of) Director of National Intelligence James Clapper by the Daily Beast\u2018s Eli Lake is worth spending a few moments examining. Last week, Lake published one excerpt of his interview where Clapper admitted that the U.S. Government should have told the American people that the NSA was collecting their communications records: as pure a vindication of Edward Snowden\u2019s choice as it gets, for obvious reasons. But there are several new, noteworthy revelations from this morning\u2019s article:\nThanks to rogue contractor Edward Snowden, the machinations of the shadow bureaucracy Clapper heads have for the last eight months been exposed one news story at a time. Clapper is often the guy who has to call newspaper editors to tell them not to print stories that they usually publish anyway.\nThis process of pre-publication notice to the government of NSA stories has been wildly misreported in some places.",
