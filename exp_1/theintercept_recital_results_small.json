From the Brexit referendum that divided the nation to the rise of populism and the challenges posed by social media, the once-stable narratives began to fracture. Sensationalism became the norm, with outlets prioritizing clicks over depth, and politicians frequently resorting to hyperbole to capture public attention. The clash of ideologies intensified, leading to a toxic environment where reasoned debate was often drowned out by outrage and polarization. Amidst this turmoil, issues like climate change, economic inequality, and social justice were relegated to the background, as both sides scrambled to dominate headlines in a seemingly endless cycle of conflict and distraction.\"",

The media grappled with how to account for the sentiments behind the Leave vote, often oscillating between disbelief and a desperate need to understand the motivations of those who voted against the establishment.\n\nThis period saw a marked shift in public discourse, where social media amplified fringe voices and alternative narratives, blurring the lines between fact and opinion. The establishment's inability to connect with large segments of the population, particularly in the North of England, led to a crisis in legitimacy for traditional political institutions.\n\nAs political debates grew increasingly polarized, accusations of elitism and detachment from the everyday concerns of citizens became commonplace.

However, as the realities of negotiations unfolded, including issues related to trade, immigration, and regulatory alignment, many citizens began to feel more skeptical of the promised outcomes.\n\nAs the government struggled to articulate a cohesive strategy, and various factions within the political landscape vied for influence, the establishment's ability to control the discourse diminished. Alternative viewpoints gained traction, often fueled by grassroots movements and social media, which allowed for a more diverse range of opinions to emerge, challenging the traditional narratives promoted by the elite.\n\nThis loss of control manifested in increasing public disillusionment with established institutions, leading to a rise in populism and a demand for more direct democracy. The media landscape also transformed, with new platforms emerging that catered to audiences seeking different perspectives. Consequently, the established norms of reporting and political commentary were questioned, giving rise to an era of information fragmentation and polarization.\n\nIn the aftermath, the British political system faced significant challenges in reconciling these divergent views and addressing the complexities of a post-Brexit reality that did not align with the initial promises made during the referendum campaign.\"",

From the shock of Brexit, which undermined long-held assumptions about the UK's place in Europe and the world, to the rise of populist movements that challenged traditional party lines, the landscape of British politics began to shift dramatically.\n\nMedia hysteria followed, with sensational headlines and polarized reporting amplifying the divisions within society. The debate surrounding immigration and sovereignty became increasingly toxic, overshadowing nuanced discussions about policy and governance. Social media emerged as a powerful force, allowing misinformation to spread rapidly and fueling a culture of outrage.\n\nAs the general election approached, political parties were forced to adapt to this new reality, often resorting to populist rhetoric to capture the attention of an increasingly volatile electorate. Within this charged atmosphere, issues such as climate change, social justice, and the economy became battlegrounds for competing narratives, each side seeking to claim moral high ground while alienating the other.\n\nThe political establishment, once seen as a stabilizing force, appeared increasingly out of touch with the sentiments of the public. Trust in traditional institutions eroded as scandals and controversies emerged, contributing to a growing sense of disillusionment among citizens. In this chaotic environment, the British political landscape became characterized by polarization, with extreme views gaining prominence and centrist voices struggling to be heard.\n\nUltimately, the cumulative effect of these turbulent events left many questioning the very foundations of British democracy, leading to a general sense of uncertainty about the future. As political leaders grappled with the emerging realities of a fractured society, the British establishment found itself at a crossroads, wrestling with both the implications of its past actions and the challenges ahead.\"",

This means individual people\u2019s searches could be easily tracked \u2013 and any user seeking out information banned by the government could potentially be at risk of interrogation or detention if security agencies were to obtain the search records from Google.\n                The search engine would be operated as part of a \u201cjoint venture\u201d partnership with a company based in mainland China, according to sources familiar with the project. People working for the joint venture would have the capability to update the search term blacklists, the sources said, raising new questions about whether Google executives in the U.S. would be able to maintain effective control and oversight over the censorship.\n                Sources familiar with Dragonfly said that the search platform also appeared to have been tailored to replace weather and air pollution data with information provided directly by an unnamed source in Beijing. The Chinese government has a record of manipulating details about pollution in the country\u2019s cities.

It has also refused to engage with human rights groups regarding Dragonfly, ignored reporters\u2019 questions, and rebuffed U.S. senators.\n                In the meantime, pressure on Google has only intensified.

Binney and the other former officials argue that the DNC data was \u201cleaked,\u201d not hacked, \u201cby a person with physical access\u201d to the DNC\u2019s computer system.\n            In an interview with The Intercept, Binney said Pompeo told him that President Donald Trump had urged the CIA director to meet with Binney to discuss his assessment that the DNC data theft was an inside job. During their hour-long meeting at CIA headquarters, Pompeo said Trump told him that if Pompeo \u201cwant[ed] to know the facts, he should talk to me,\u201d Binney said.\n            A senior intelligence source confirmed that Pompeo met with Binney to discuss his analysis, and that the CIA director held the meeting at Trump\u2019s urging. The Intercept\u2019s account of the meeting is based on interviews with Binney, the senior intelligence source, a colleague who accompanied Binney to CIA headquarters, and others who Binney told about the meeting. A CIA spokesperson declined to comment. \u201cAs a general matter, we do not comment on the Director\u2019s schedule,\u201d said Dean Boyd, director of the CIA\u2019s Office of Public Affairs.\n            Binney said that Pompeo asked whether he would be willing to meet with NSA and FBI officials to further discuss his analysis of the DNC data theft. Binney agreed and said Pompeo said he would contact him when he had arranged the meetings.\n            It is highly unorthodox for the CIA director to reach out to someone like Binney, a 74-year-old ex-government employee who rose to prominence as an NSA whistleblower wrongfully persecuted by the government, for help with fact-finding related to the theft of the DNC emails. It is particularly stunning that Pompeo would meet with Binney at Trump\u2019s apparent urging, in what could be seen as an effort to discredit the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s own assessment that an alleged Russian hack of the DNC servers was part of an effort to help Trump win the presidency.\n            It is possible Trump learned about Binney and his analysis by watching Fox News, where Binney has been a frequent guest, appearing at least 10 times since September 2016. In August, Binney appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox show to discuss his assessment that the narrative of Russia hacking the DNC during the 2016 campaign is untrue, stating that \u201cmany people are emotionally tied to this agenda, to tie the Russians to President Trump.\u201d Binney said he is not sure how Trump found out about his analysis.\n            However the meeting came about, the fact that Pompeo was apparently willing to follow Trump\u2019s direction and invite Binney to discuss his analysis has alarmed some current and former intelligence officials.\n            \u201cThis is crazy. You\u2019ve got all these intelligence agencies saying the Russians did the hack. To deny that is like coming out with the theory that the Japanese didn\u2019t bomb Pearl Harbor,\u201d said one former CIA officer.\n            Binney, for his part, is happy that the meeting occurred and eager to help Pompeo and Trump get to the bottom of the DNC email theft because he believes the intelligence community has not told the truth about what happened.\n            \u201cI was willing to meet Pompeo simply because it was clear to me the intelligence community wasn\u2019t being honest here,\u201d Binney said, referring to their assessment of the DNC email theft. \u201cI am quite willing to help people who need the truth to find the truth and not simply have deceptive statements from the intelligence community.\u201d\n            ",

            "text": "THE ANALYSIS BY Binney and his colleagues aligns neatly with Trump\u2019s frequent public skepticism of the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 campaign to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and help elect Trump. The declassified summary of a U.S. intelligence community report, based on the work of the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA and made public in early January before Trump\u2019s inauguration, stated that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d Trump has frequently raged against the accusation that he won the presidency thanks to help from the Russians, labeling the charge \u201cfake news.\u201d\n                \u201cThe Director stands by, and has always stood by, the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment,\u201d Boyd, the CIA spokesperson, said.\n                Binney\u2019s claim that the email theft was committed by an insider at the DNC also helps fuel one of the more bizarre conspiracy theories that has gained traction on the right: that the murder of a young DNC staffer last year was somehow connected to the data theft. Binney said he mentioned the case of Seth Rich to Pompeo during their meeting.\n                The meeting raises questions about Pompeo\u2019s willingness to act as an honest broker between the intelligence community and the White House, and his apparent refusal to push back against efforts by the president to bend the intelligence process to suit his political purposes. Instead of acting as a filter between Trump and the intelligence community, Pompeo\u2019s decision to meet with Binney raises the possibility that right-wing theories aired on Fox News and in other conservative media can now move not just from conservative pundits to Trump, but also from Trump to Pompeo and into the bloodstream of the intelligence community.\n                Some senior CIA officials have grown upset that Pompeo, a former Republican representative from Kansas, has become so close to Trump that the CIA director regularly expresses skepticism about intelligence that doesn\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s views. Pompeo has also alienated some CIA managers by growing belligerent toward them in meetings, according to an intelligence official familiar with the matter.\n                The CIA, however, strongly objected to this characterization. \u201cThe Director has been adamant that CIA officers have the time, space and resources to make sound and unbiased assessments that are delivered to policy makers without fear or favor,\u201d Boyd said in an email to The Intercept. \u201cAs he has stated repeatedly, when we deliver our assessments to policy makers, we must do so with complete candor. He has also pushed decision making down in the organization, giving officers greater ownership of their work and making them more accountable for the outcomes. These changes are designed to make CIA more agile, aggressive and responsive.\u201d\n                Yet indications of Pompeo\u2019s willingness to support Trump at the risk of tainting the intelligence process have occasionally broken into the open in recent months. In August, the Washington Post reported that Pompeo had taken the unusual step of having the CIA\u2019s Counterintelligence Mission Center, which would likely play a role in any inquiries by the agency into Russian election meddling, report directly to him. That move has raised concerns within the agency that Pompeo is seeking to personally control the CIA\u2019s efforts to investigate accusations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n                More recently, at a Washington event in October, Pompeo said that U.S. intelligence had determined that Moscow\u2019s intervention hadn\u2019t impacted the outcome of the election. He was quickly criticized for the comments, and the CIA had to issue a clarification saying that the intelligence assessment on Russia hadn\u2019t been altered.\n                While Pompeo seems to be actively taking Trump\u2019s side on contentious issues like Russian collusion, Dan Coats, the former Republican senator who now serves as director of national intelligence, has been largely missing in action. Coats has been reluctant to push for an aggressive Trump-Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n                By contrast, Coats\u2019s predecessor, James Clapper, saw himself as the public face of the intelligence community and its spokesperson. Now out of government, Clapper, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has become an ardent advocate for a thorough investigation of Trump and Russia. Clapper told Politico in late October that the Russian election hacking was designed to help Trump win. \u201cThe Russians have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations,\u201d he said.\n                With Coats largely out of the picture and Pompeo actively siding with Trump, the intelligence community is effectively leaderless as it struggles to come to grips with its role in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The lack of aggressive support from the intelligence community could hamper the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Trump and Russia. Eventually, that lack of support could make it more difficult for Mueller\u2019s team to glean information from inside Russia.\n                Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Binney came just days before the first charges from Mueller\u2019s investigation were made public on October 30. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with their work with a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. It was also disclosed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty earlier in October to making a false statement to the FBI in connection with his efforts to develop Russian ties during the campaign. Through a plea agreement, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigators.\n                Clearly anxious as the Mueller investigation looms over his presidency, Trump has continued to promote alternative theories that would exonerate him and his campaign. Binney\u2019s analysis falls squarely into that category.",

The declassified summary of a U.S. intelligence community report, based on the work of the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA and made public in early January before Trump\u2019s inauguration, stated that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.

Binney said he mentioned the case of Seth Rich to Pompeo during their meeting.\n                The meeting raises questions about Pompeo\u2019s willingness to act as an honest broker between the intelligence community and the White House, and his apparent refusal to push back against efforts by the president to bend the intelligence process to suit his political purposes. Instead of acting as a filter between Trump and the intelligence community, Pompeo\u2019s decision to meet with Binney raises the possibility that right-wing theories aired on Fox News and in other conservative media can now move not just from conservative pundits to Trump, but also from Trump to Pompeo and into the bloodstream of the intelligence community.\n                Some senior CIA officials have grown upset that Pompeo, a former Republican representative from Kansas, has become so close to Trump that the CIA director regularly expresses skepticism about intelligence that doesn\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s views. Pompeo has also alienated some CIA managers by growing belligerent toward them in meetings, according to an intelligence official familiar with the matter.\n                The CIA, however, strongly objected to this characterization. \u201cThe Director has been adamant that CIA officers have the time, space and resources to make sound and unbiased assessments that are delivered to policy makers without fear or favor,\u201d Boyd said in an email to The Intercept. \u201cAs he has stated repeatedly, when we deliver our assessments to policy makers, we must do so with complete candor. He has also pushed decision making down in the organization, giving officers greater ownership of their work and making them more accountable for the outcomes. These changes are designed to make CIA more agile, aggressive and responsive.\u201d\n                Yet indications of Pompeo\u2019s willingness to support Trump at the risk of tainting the intelligence process have occasionally broken into the open in recent months. In August, the Washington Post reported that Pompeo had taken the unusual step of having the CIA\u2019s Counterintelligence Mission Center, which would likely play a role in any inquiries by the agency into Russian election meddling, report directly to him. That move has raised concerns within the agency that Pompeo is seeking to personally control the CIA\u2019s efforts to investigate accusations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n                More recently, at a Washington event in October, Pompeo said that U.S. intelligence had determined that Moscow\u2019s intervention hadn\u2019t impacted the outcome of the election. He was quickly criticized for the comments, and the CIA had to issue a clarification saying that the intelligence assessment on Russia hadn\u2019t been altered.\n                While Pompeo seems to be actively taking Trump\u2019s side on contentious issues like Russian collusion, Dan Coats, the former Republican senator who now serves as director of national intelligence, has been largely missing in action. Coats has been reluctant to push for an aggressive Trump-Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n                By contrast, Coats\u2019s predecessor, James Clapper, saw himself as the public face of the intelligence community and its spokesperson. Now out of government, Clapper, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has become an ardent advocate for a thorough investigation of Trump and Russia. Clapper told Politico in late October that the Russian election hacking was designed to help Trump win. \u201cThe Russians have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations,\u201d he said.\n                With Coats largely out of the picture and Pompeo actively siding with Trump, the intelligence community is effectively leaderless as it struggles to come to grips with its role in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The lack of aggressive support from the intelligence community could hamper the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Trump and Russia. Eventually, that lack of support could make it more difficult for Mueller\u2019s team to glean information from inside Russia.\n                Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Binney came just days before the first charges from Mueller\u2019s investigation were made public on October 30. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with their work with a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. It was also disclosed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty earlier in October to making a false statement to the FBI in connection with his efforts to develop Russian ties during the campaign. Through a plea agreement, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigators.\n                Clearly anxious as the Mueller investigation looms over his presidency, Trump has continued to promote alternative theories that would exonerate him and his campaign.

Instead of acting as a filter between Trump and the intelligence community, Pompeo\u2019s decision to meet with Binney raises the possibility that right-wing theories aired on Fox News and in other conservative media can now move not just from conservative pundits to Trump, but also from Trump to Pompeo and into the bloodstream of the intelligence community.\n                Some senior CIA officials have grown upset that Pompeo, a former Republican representative from Kansas, has become so close to Trump that the CIA director regularly expresses skepticism about intelligence that doesn\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s views. Pompeo has also alienated some CIA managers by growing belligerent toward them in meetings, according to an intelligence official familiar with the matter.\n                The CIA, however, strongly objected to this characterization. \u201cThe Director has been adamant that CIA officers have the time, space and resources to make sound and unbiased assessments that are delivered to policy makers without fear or favor,\u201d Boyd said in an email to The Intercept. \u201cAs he has stated repeatedly, when we deliver our assessments to policy makers, we must do so with complete candor. He has also pushed decision making down in the organization, giving officers greater ownership of their work and making them more accountable for the outcomes. These changes are designed to make CIA more agile, aggressive and responsive.\u201d\n                Yet indications of Pompeo\u2019s willingness to support Trump at the risk of tainting the intelligence process have occasionally broken into the open in recent months. In August, the Washington Post reported that Pompeo had taken the unusual step of having the CIA\u2019s Counterintelligence Mission Center, which would likely play a role in any inquiries by the agency into Russian election meddling, report directly to him. That move has raised concerns within the agency that Pompeo is seeking to personally control the CIA\u2019s efforts to investigate accusations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n                More recently, at a Washington event in October, Pompeo said that U.S. intelligence had determined that Moscow\u2019s intervention hadn\u2019t impacted the outcome of the election. He was quickly criticized for the comments, and the CIA had to issue a clarification saying that the intelligence assessment on Russia hadn\u2019t been altered.\n                While Pompeo seems to be actively taking Trump\u2019s side on contentious issues like Russian collusion, Dan Coats, the former Republican senator who now serves as director of national intelligence, has been largely missing in action. Coats has been reluctant to push for an aggressive Trump-Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n                By contrast, Coats\u2019s predecessor, James Clapper, saw himself as the public face of the intelligence community and its spokesperson. Now out of government, Clapper, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has become an ardent advocate for a thorough investigation of Trump and Russia. Clapper told Politico in late October that the Russian election hacking was designed to help Trump win. \u201cThe Russians have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations,\u201d he said.\n                With Coats largely out of the picture and Pompeo actively siding with Trump, the intelligence community is effectively leaderless as it struggles to come to grips with its role in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The lack of aggressive support from the intelligence community could hamper the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Trump and Russia. Eventually, that lack of support could make it more difficult for Mueller\u2019s team to glean information from inside Russia.\n                Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Binney came just days before the first charges from Mueller\u2019s investigation were made public on October 30. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with their work with a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. It was also disclosed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty earlier in October to making a false statement to the FBI in connection with his efforts to develop Russian ties during the campaign. Through a plea agreement, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigators.\n                Clearly anxious as the Mueller investigation looms over his presidency, Trump has continued to promote alternative theories that would exonerate him and his campaign.

He was quickly criticized for the comments, and the CIA had to issue a clarification saying that the intelligence assessment on Russia hadn\u2019t been altered.\n                While Pompeo seems to be actively taking Trump\u2019s side on contentious issues like Russian collusion, Dan Coats, the former Republican senator who now serves as director of national intelligence, has been largely missing in action. Coats has been reluctant to push for an aggressive Trump-Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n                By contrast, Coats\u2019s predecessor, James Clapper, saw himself as the public face of the intelligence community and its spokesperson. Now out of government, Clapper, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has become an ardent advocate for a thorough investigation of Trump and Russia. Clapper told Politico in late October that the Russian election hacking was designed to help Trump win. \u201cThe Russians have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations,\u201d he said.\n                With Coats largely out of the picture and Pompeo actively siding with Trump, the intelligence community is effectively leaderless as it struggles to come to grips with its role in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The lack of aggressive support from the intelligence community could hamper the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Trump and Russia. Eventually, that lack of support could make it more difficult for Mueller\u2019s team to glean information from inside Russia.\n                Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Binney came just days before the first charges from Mueller\u2019s investigation were made public on October 30. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with their work with a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. It was also disclosed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty earlier in October to making a false statement to the FBI in connection with his efforts to develop Russian ties during the campaign. Through a plea agreement, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigators.\n                Clearly anxious as the Mueller investigation looms over his presidency, Trump has continued to promote alternative theories that would exonerate him and his campaign. Binney\u2019s analysis falls squarely into that category.",

Binney, a former technical director for the NSA, has raised concerns about the security of voting systems and the potential for manipulation. His analyses suggest that the way votes were counted and reported during the 2020 election may not accurately reflect the true voter intent. This resonates with Trump's unyielding claims of widespread voter fraud and irregularities, claims that have been widely disputed by various election officials and watchdog organizations. \n\nDespite the lack of concrete evidence supporting Trump\u2019s assertions, the findings of Binney and others who share similar views have contributed to a persistent narrative among Trump's supporters that the election was not legitimate. This phenomenon has sparked ongoing debates about election security, the role of technology in voting, and the integrity of democratic processes in the United States.\n\nAs discussions continue, the implications of Binney's analysis and Trump's skepticism go beyond the 2020 election. They raise fundamental questions about trust in electoral systems, the impact of misinformation on public perception, and the broader consequences for democratic institutions. Understanding the intersection of technological analysis and political rhetoric is crucial to navigating the evolving landscape of American democracy.",

            "text": "THE ANALYSIS BY Binney and his colleagues aligns neatly with Trump\u2019s frequent public skepticism of the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 campaign to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and help elect Trump. The declassified summary of a U.S. intelligence community report, based on the work of the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA and made public in early January before Trump\u2019s inauguration, stated that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d Trump has frequently raged against the accusation that he won the presidency thanks to help from the Russians, labeling the charge \u201cfake news.\u201d\n                \u201cThe Director stands by, and has always stood by, the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment,\u201d Boyd, the CIA spokesperson, said.\n                Binney\u2019s claim that the email theft was committed by an insider at the DNC also helps fuel one of the more bizarre conspiracy theories that has gained traction on the right: that the murder of a young DNC staffer last year was somehow connected to the data theft. Binney said he mentioned the case of Seth Rich to Pompeo during their meeting.\n                The meeting raises questions about Pompeo\u2019s willingness to act as an honest broker between the intelligence community and the White House, and his apparent refusal to push back against efforts by the president to bend the intelligence process to suit his political purposes. Instead of acting as a filter between Trump and the intelligence community, Pompeo\u2019s decision to meet with Binney raises the possibility that right-wing theories aired on Fox News and in other conservative media can now move not just from conservative pundits to Trump, but also from Trump to Pompeo and into the bloodstream of the intelligence community.\n                Some senior CIA officials have grown upset that Pompeo, a former Republican representative from Kansas, has become so close to Trump that the CIA director regularly expresses skepticism about intelligence that doesn\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s views. Pompeo has also alienated some CIA managers by growing belligerent toward them in meetings, according to an intelligence official familiar with the matter.\n                The CIA, however, strongly objected to this characterization. \u201cThe Director has been adamant that CIA officers have the time, space and resources to make sound and unbiased assessments that are delivered to policy makers without fear or favor,\u201d Boyd said in an email to The Intercept. \u201cAs he has stated repeatedly, when we deliver our assessments to policy makers, we must do so with complete candor. He has also pushed decision making down in the organization, giving officers greater ownership of their work and making them more accountable for the outcomes. These changes are designed to make CIA more agile, aggressive and responsive.\u201d\n                Yet indications of Pompeo\u2019s willingness to support Trump at the risk of tainting the intelligence process have occasionally broken into the open in recent months. In August, the Washington Post reported that Pompeo had taken the unusual step of having the CIA\u2019s Counterintelligence Mission Center, which would likely play a role in any inquiries by the agency into Russian election meddling, report directly to him. That move has raised concerns within the agency that Pompeo is seeking to personally control the CIA\u2019s efforts to investigate accusations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n                More recently, at a Washington event in October, Pompeo said that U.S. intelligence had determined that Moscow\u2019s intervention hadn\u2019t impacted the outcome of the election. He was quickly criticized for the comments, and the CIA had to issue a clarification saying that the intelligence assessment on Russia hadn\u2019t been altered.\n                While Pompeo seems to be actively taking Trump\u2019s side on contentious issues like Russian collusion, Dan Coats, the former Republican senator who now serves as director of national intelligence, has been largely missing in action. Coats has been reluctant to push for an aggressive Trump-Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n                By contrast, Coats\u2019s predecessor, James Clapper, saw himself as the public face of the intelligence community and its spokesperson. Now out of government, Clapper, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, has become an ardent advocate for a thorough investigation of Trump and Russia. Clapper told Politico in late October that the Russian election hacking was designed to help Trump win. \u201cThe Russians have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations,\u201d he said.\n                With Coats largely out of the picture and Pompeo actively siding with Trump, the intelligence community is effectively leaderless as it struggles to come to grips with its role in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The lack of aggressive support from the intelligence community could hamper the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Trump and Russia. Eventually, that lack of support could make it more difficult for Mueller\u2019s team to glean information from inside Russia.\n                Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Binney came just days before the first charges from Mueller\u2019s investigation were made public on October 30. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with their work with a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. It was also disclosed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty earlier in October to making a false statement to the FBI in connection with his efforts to develop Russian ties during the campaign. Through a plea agreement, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigators.\n                Clearly anxious as the Mueller investigation looms over his presidency, Trump has continued to promote alternative theories that would exonerate him and his campaign. Binney\u2019s analysis falls squarely into that category.",

            "text": "THE ANALYSIS BY Binney and his colleagues aligns neatly with Trump\u2019s frequent public skepticism of the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 campaign to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and help elect Trump. The declassified summary of a U.S. intelligence community report, based on the work of the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA and made public in early January before Trump\u2019s inauguration, stated that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d Trump has frequently raged against the accusation that he won the presidency thanks to help from the Russians, labeling the charge \u201cfake news.\u201d\n                \u201cThe Director stands by, and has always stood by, the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment,\u201d Boyd, the CIA spokesperson, said.\n                Binney\u2019s claim that the email theft was committed by an insider at the DNC also helps fuel one of the more bizarre conspiracy theories that has gained traction on the right: that the murder of a young DNC staffer last year was somehow connected to the data theft. Binney said he mentioned the case of Seth Rich to Pompeo during their meeting.\n                The meeting raises questions about Pompeo\u2019s willingness to act as an honest broker between the intelligence community and the White House, and his apparent refusal to push back against efforts by the president to bend the intelligence process to suit his political purposes. Instead of acting as a filter between Trump and the intelligence community, Pompeo\u2019s decision to meet with Binney raises the possibility that right-wing theories aired on Fox News and in other conservative media can now move not just from conservative pundits to Trump, but also from Trump to Pompeo and into the bloodstream of the intelligence community.\n                Some senior CIA officials have grown upset that Pompeo, a former Republican representative from Kansas, has become so close to Trump that the CIA director regularly expresses skepticism about intelligence that doesn\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s views. Pompeo has also alienated some CIA managers by growing belligerent toward them in meetings, according to an intelligence official familiar with the matter.\n                The CIA, however, strongly objected to this characterization. \u201cThe Director has been adamant that CIA officers have the time, space and resources to make sound and unbiased assessments that are delivered to policy makers without fear or favor,\u201d Boyd said in an email to The Intercept. \u201cAs he has stated repeatedly, when we deliver our assessments to policy makers, we must do so with complete candor. He has also pushed decision making down in the organization, giving officers greater ownership of their work and making them more accountable for the outcomes. These changes are designed to make CIA more agile, aggressive and responsive.\u201d\n                Yet indications of Pompeo\u2019s willingness to support Trump at the risk of tainting the intelligence process have occasionally broken into the open in recent months. In August, the Washington Post reported that Pompeo had taken the unusual step of having the CIA\u2019s Counterintelligence Mission Center, which would likely play a role in any inquiries by the agency into Russian election meddling, report directly to him. That move has raised concerns within the agency that Pompeo is seeking to personally control the CIA\u2019s efforts to investigate accusations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n                More recently, at a Washington event in October, Pompeo said that U.S. intelligence had determined that Moscow\u2019s intervention hadn\u2019t impacted the outcome of the election. He was quickly criticized for the comments, and the CIA had to issue a clarification saying that the intelligence assessment on Russia hadn\u2019t been altered.\n                While Pompeo seems to be actively taking Trump\u2019s side on contentious issues like Russian collusion, Dan Coats, the former Republican senator who now serves as director of national intelligence, has been largely missing in action.

The lack of aggressive support from the intelligence community could hamper the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between Trump and Russia. Eventually, that lack of support could make it more difficult for Mueller\u2019s team to glean information from inside Russia.\n                Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Binney came just days before the first charges from Mueller\u2019s investigation were made public on October 30. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates were charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with their work with a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. It was also disclosed that George Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, pleaded guilty earlier in October to making a false statement to the FBI in connection with his efforts to develop Russian ties during the campaign. Through a plea agreement, Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigators.\n                Clearly anxious as the Mueller investigation looms over his presidency, Trump has continued to promote alternative theories that would exonerate him and his campaign. Binney\u2019s analysis falls squarely into that category.",
