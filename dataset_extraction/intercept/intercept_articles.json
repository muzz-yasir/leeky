    "content": "(atualizado abaixo, com a colabora\u00e7\u00e3o de leitores)\nA popula\u00e7\u00e3o voltou \u00e0s ruas neste domingo, dia 4, quatro dias depois de Michel Temer tomar posse em consequ\u00eancia ao impeachment de Dilma Rousseff. Em viagem \u00e0 China, Temer menosprezou o tamanho das manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es: \u201cs\u00e3o 40, 50, 100 pessoas, nada mais do que isso\u201d. Para os organizadores, eram 100 mil pessoas. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil dar uma conta exata de quantas foram para as ruas na capital de S\u00e3o Paulo para gritar \u201cFora, Temer\u201d. Mas basta uma foto para constatar que Temer errou por umas dezenas de milhares:\nManifestantes iniciam passeata contra o governo do presidente da Rep\u00fablica, Michel Temer, na avenida Paulista pic.twitter.com/eEvyIeyE3s\n\u2014 BBC Brasil (@bbcbrasil) 4 de setembro de 2016\nEra s\u00f3 o come\u00e7o. Primeiro a Dilma, depois o resto. Esse n\u00e3o era o discurso dos movimentos que levaram milhares de brasileiros \u00e0s ruas? Pois o depois se tornou o presente. Chegou a hora do \u201cresto\u201d.\nSeguindo a l\u00f3gica das campanhas pol\u00edticas brasileiras, algumas coisas ficaram apenas na promessa, e \u201co resto\u201d tentou ser esquecido. Em vez de \u201cprimeiro, a gente tira a Dilma e, depois, o resto\u201d, primeiro, afastou-se a ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff, por ter alterado os gastos do governo sem consultar o Congresso. E, depois \u2014dois dias depois\u2014 , o Senado alterou a lei, de forma a n\u00e3o se precisar mais da permiss\u00e3o do Congresso.\n\u201cFora, Dilma.\u201d E depois\u2026?\nEsquecer o que se promete ou que se fala \u00e9 pr\u00e1tica comum na classe pol\u00edtica. O mesmo Michel Temer que hoje demonstra algum problema de vis\u00e3o \u2014 ou de matem\u00e1tica \u2014 ao estimar o tamanho das manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es, h\u00e1 pouco mais de um ano classificava o impeachment como \u201cimpens\u00e1vel\u201d.\n\u201cO impeachment \u00e9 impens\u00e1vel, geraria uma crise institucional. N\u00e3o tem base jur\u00eddica e nem pol\u00edtica\u201d\n\u2014 Michel Temer (@MichelTemer) 30 de mar\u00e7o de 2015\nJ\u00e1 o presidente em exerc\u00edcio, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), foi certeiro e previu a repress\u00e3o policial nas manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es que viriam, ainda no in\u00edcio de 2015.\nRodrigo Maia: Impeachment, com as palavras do pres. Lula, nao vai ser como Collor. Vai ser com muito sangue na rua. http://t.co/rHsYUTAumq \u2014 M\u00f4nica Bergamo (@monicabergamo) 1 de mar\u00e7o de 2015\nMas isso n\u00e3o o impediu de votar a favor e, inclusive, dedicar o voto a seu pai, Cesar Maia. Ironicamente, Maia, o pai, teve o mandato cassado na semana final do julgamento do impeachment de Rousseff. Ele contratou seu cunhado, o advogado Paulo Eduardo de Ara\u00fajo Saboya, 27 vezes sem licita\u00e7\u00e3o. Os contratos somam R$ 220 mil.\nOutro que teve vis\u00e3o foi o ex-presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Em 2012, durante uma entrevista para o jornal Folha de S. Paulo, o soci\u00f3logo cantou a pedra, em pleno per\u00edodo de elogiada \u201cfaxina \u00e9tica\u201d:\n\u201cQuando Jango caiu, era claro que ele havia perdido a capacidade de governar porque o Congresso n\u00e3o seguia mais as determina\u00e7\u00f5es. O Congresso bloqueia. J\u00e2nio caiu porque se chocou com o Congresso tamb\u00e9m. Tinha a maioria do povo, mas n\u00e3o tinha o Congresso. O Collor, tamb\u00e9m. O Lula entendeu [o papel do Congresso], talvez, n\u00e3o no sentido que eu acharia melhor. Ele cedeu no que n\u00e3o deveria ceder. N\u00e3o sei se a Dilma percebe os riscos.\u201d [\u00eanfase adicionado]\nTr\u00eas anos depois, no entanto, em mar\u00e7o de 2015 durante outra entrevista \u00e0 imprensa, desta vez ao jornal Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, ele afirmou que \u201co caminho\u201d era o impeachment. Disse tamb\u00e9m que \u201cas ruas gritaram ren\u00fancia, fim, impeachment\u201d.\nAgora as ruas gritam \u201cFora, Temer\u201d. Ser\u00e1 que ele est\u00e1 ouvindo?\nAp\u00f3s Temer desdenhar \u201c40\u201d manifestantes contra governo, SP tem maior protesto at\u00e9 agora. Mas PM n\u00e3o estimou p\u00fablico pic.twitter.com/og2TjGMawV \u2014 BuzzFeedNewsBR (@BuzzFeedNewsBR) 4 de setembro de 2016\nJ\u00e1 o ex-presidente e hoje senador Fernando Collor (PTC-AL) disse ao jornal ga\u00facho Zero Hora, em 2014, que era partid\u00e1rio do \u201cFica, Dilma\u201d.\nREP\u00d3RTER \u2013 O senhor vai votar na presidente Dilma?\nCOLLOR \u2013 Vou votar na Dilma.\nREP\u00d3RTER \u2013 N\u00e3o \u00e9 daqueles que engrossam o coro do \u201cVolta, Lula\u201d?\nCOLLOR \u2013 N\u00e3o! Eu sou dos que engrossam o de \u201cFica, Dilma\u201d (risos).\nAparentemente, ele mudou de ideia ao longo dos anos. Em 2016, disse sim ao impeachment, lembrando em seu voto o impeachment que ele mesmo sofreu, em 1992. Disse que \u201co rito \u00e9 o mesmo, mas o ritmo e o vigor, n\u00e3o\u201d, indicando que seu processo foi muito mais r\u00e1pido do que o que levou ao afastamento de Rousseff.\nCollor s\u00f3 esqueceu de citar em seu voto que os dois processos de impeachment s\u00e3o bem diferentes. No seu caso, envolveu alega\u00e7\u00f5es de crimes como corrup\u00e7\u00e3o passiva e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de quadrilha, enquanto Rousseff respondia por suposta crime de responsabilidade fiscal.\nEssa aparente confus\u00e3o mental n\u00e3o \u00e9 exclusiva da direita, tampouco do atual governo. A ex-candidata \u00e0 presid\u00eancia Luciana Genro (PSOL-RS) discordava totalmente da hip\u00f3tese de um golpe, em mar\u00e7o de 2016, quando diz, \u201cos l\u00edderes do PT est\u00e3o brincando com as palavras, dizendo que h\u00e1 golpe.\u201d Mas apenas cinco meses depois classificou de \u201cgolpe palaciano\u201d o que estava acontecendo no pa\u00eds:\u201cEu, que n\u00e3o votei em Temer nem para vice-presidente, \u00e9 claro que n\u00e3o o aceito como presidente. Ainda mais quando sua presid\u00eancia definitiva \u00e9 produto de um golpe palaciano desferido no seu antigo aliado, o PT, que com ele compartilhou o poder por anos.\u201d\nE como esquecer a ainda candidata Dilma Rousseff exaltando seu ent\u00e3o candidato a vice-presidente, Michel Temer, dizendo que ele saberia \u201chonrar e me substituir \u00e0 altura\u201d? O que, depois, lamentou profundamente.\nEssa aparente mudan\u00e7a de posi\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o pega desprevenido quem acompanha o notici\u00e1rio de Bras\u00edlia. Quem ouviu os \u00e1udios dos grampos de S\u00e9rgio Machado divulgados em maio de 2016 j\u00e1 sabia que o \u201cFora, Dilma\u201d n\u00e3o seria seguido do \u201cdepois o resto\u201d. O ex-presidente da Transpetro gravou suas negocia\u00e7\u00f5es com o ex-ministro do planejamento Romero Juc\u00e1 (PMDB-RR) sobre uma forma de afastar Rousseff para, assim, estancar o avan\u00e7o da opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato. Apenas para refrescar a mem\u00f3ria:\nMACHADO \u2013 Rapaz, a solu\u00e7\u00e3o mais f\u00e1cil era botar o Michel [Temer].\nJUC\u00c1 \u2013 S\u00f3 o Renan [Calheiros] que est\u00e1 contra essa porra. \u2018Porque n\u00e3o gosta do Michel, porque o Michel \u00e9 Eduardo Cunha\u2019. Gente, esquece o Eduardo Cunha, o Eduardo Cunha est\u00e1 morto, porra.\nMACHADO \u2013 \u00c9 um acordo, botar o Michel, num grande acordo nacional.\nJUC\u00c1 \u2013 Com o Supremo, com tudo.\nMACHADO \u2013 Com tudo, a\u00ed parava tudo.\nJUC\u00c1 \u2013 \u00c9. Delimitava onde est\u00e1, pronto.\nQuem quiser lembrar da grava\u00e7\u00e3o completa, aqui vai.\nAssim se monta a realidade em que o governo fala que n\u00e3o vai mexer nos programas sociais, mas pede um corte m\u00e9dio de 30% nos mesmos; ou que fala em corte de gastos, mas adota medidas que n\u00e3o trazem corte efetivo de despesas.\nEnquanto isso, o povo volta \u00e0s ruas. Porque, por mais que se diga que tem ele mem\u00f3ria curta, ele se lembra.\nATUALIZA\u00c7\u00c3O:\nThe Intercept Brasil solicitou via Twitter que os leitores enviassem mais casos como os relatados acima. Abaixo, os melhores exemplos apontados por leitores at\u00e9 agora:\nDurante a campanha de 2014 Rousseff j\u00e1 sabia que \u201csem apoio no Congresso Nacional n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel assegurar um governo est\u00e1vel\u201d, como ela mesma disse durante um dos debates daquele ano. Inclusive, a ent\u00e3o candidata chegou a mencionar em seu programa eleitoral que Marina Silva (Rede) poderia sofrer impeachment por ter uma base restrita no parlamento.\nhttps://twitter.com/belisards/status/772985302570983424\nO senador Telm\u00e1rio Mota (PDT-RR) pediu a suspens\u00e3o e o arquivamento do impeachment ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) em abril de 2016, mas votou a favor do afastamento de Dilma no julgamento, dia 31 de agosto. Dois dias antes, ele havia defendido a ent\u00e3o presidente e dito que n\u00e3o havia crime de responsabilidade.\n@HelenaTIB Telmario Mota pediu anula\u00e7\u00e3o do impeachmento no STF. https://t.co/kiGhXI3Fnl Mas mudou de ideia no Senado https://t.co/bUvseYaxmN\n\u2014 Carolina Oms (@carolisoms) September 6, 2016\nEntre outros nomes, Eduardo Cunha tamb\u00e9m mudou de opini\u00e3o sobre o impeachment. Fomos atr\u00e1s da dica e encontramos uma entrevista do ent\u00e3o presidente da C\u00e2mara no programa Roda Viva em mar\u00e7o de 2015. Entre as muitas coisas que ele disse durante mais de uma hora de grava\u00e7\u00e3o, destaca-se o trecho abaixo:\n\u201cN\u00f3s n\u00e3o podemos transformar a discuss\u00e3o sobre o impedimento de um presidente da rep\u00fablica numa forma de discuss\u00e3o pol\u00edtica, porque ele n\u00e3o \u00e9. O impedimento tem as suas previs\u00f5es constitucionais para os casos espec\u00edficos aos quais, no meu entender, n\u00e3o est\u00e1 se aplicando. Ent\u00e3o, consequentemente, eu n\u00e3o posso querer dar curso para resolver uma crise pol\u00edtica. Achar que a gente virou uma republiqueta que vai arrancar o presidente fora, que foi legitimamente eleito. N\u00f3s n\u00e3o concordamos com essa forma.\u201d [\u00eanfase adicionado]\nComo se bem sabe, Cunha ficou conhecido como aquele que entregou o impeachment em troca de \u201canistia\u201d.\nhttps://twitter.com/MCeceCT/status/772942539838132224\nEncontramos mudan\u00e7as de posi\u00e7\u00e3o de Telm\u00e1rio Mota e Eduardo Cunha, mas n\u00e3o encontramos opini\u00f5es anteriores de Renan Calheiros, que preferiu guardar para si a decis\u00e3o at\u00e9 o \u00faltimo minuto. Uma semana antes da vota\u00e7\u00e3o final, Calheiros sequer dava certeza se iria votar ou n\u00e3o no julgamento.\nCom os agradecimentos aos leitores @MCeceCT, @carolisoms e @belisards.\nJ\u00c1 EST\u00c1 ACONTECENDO\nQuando o assunto \u00e9 a ascens\u00e3o da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa \u00e9 uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3 para anos eleitorais.

    "title": "The NSA's British Base at the Heart of U.S. Targeted Killing",
    "content": "The narrow roads are quiet and winding, surrounded by rolling green fields and few visible signs of life beyond the occasional herd of sheep. But on the horizon, massive white golf ball-like domes protrude from the earth, protected behind a perimeter fence that is topped with piercing razor wire. Here, in the heart of the tranquil English countryside, is the National Security Agency\u2019s largest overseas spying base.\nOnce known only by the code name Field Station 8613, the secret base \u2014 now called Menwith Hill Station \u2014 is located about nine miles west of the small town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire. Originally used to monitor Soviet communications through the Cold War, its focus has since dramatically shifted, and today it is a vital part of the NSA\u2019s sprawling global surveillance network.\nFor years, journalists and researchers have speculated about what really goes on inside Menwith Hill, while human rights groups and some politicians have campaigned for more transparency about its activities. Yet the British government has steadfastly refused to comment, citing a longstanding policy not to discuss matters related to national security.\nNow, however, top-secret documents obtained by The Intercept offer an unprecedented glimpse behind Menwith Hill\u2019s razor wire fence. The files reveal for the first time how the NSA has used the British base to aid \u201ca significant number of capture-kill operations\u201d across the Middle East and North Africa, fueled by powerful eavesdropping technology that can harvest data from more than 300 million emails and phone calls a day.\nOver the past decade, the documents show, the NSA has pioneered groundbreaking new spying programs at Menwith Hill to pinpoint the locations of suspected terrorists accessing the internet in remote parts of the world. The programs \u2014 with names such as GHOSTHUNTER and GHOSTWOLF \u2014 have provided support for conventional British and American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. But they have also aided covert missions in countries where the U.S. has not declared war. NSA employees at Menwith Hill have collaborated on a project to help \u201celiminate\u201d terrorism targets in Yemen, for example, where the U.S. has waged a controversial drone bombing campaign that has resulted in dozens of civilian deaths.\nThe disclosures about Menwith Hill raise new questions about the extent of British complicity in U.S. drone strikes and other so-called targeted killing missions, which may in some cases have violated international laws or constituted war crimes. Successive U.K. governments have publicly stated that all activities at the base are carried out with the \u201cfull knowledge and consent\u201d of British officials.\nThe revelations are \u201cyet another example of the unacceptable level of secrecy that surrounds U.K. involvement in the U.S. \u2018targeted killing\u2019 program,\u201d Kat Craig, legal director of London-based human rights group Reprieve, told The Intercept.\n\u201cIt is now imperative that the prime minister comes clean about U.K. involvement in targeted killing,\u201d Craig said, \u201cto ensure that British personnel and resources are not implicated in illegal and immoral activities.\u201d\nThe British government\u2019s Ministry of Defence, which handles media inquires related to Menwith Hill, declined to comment for this story.\nThe NSA referred a request for comment to the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s office.\nRichard Kolko, a spokesperson for the DNI, said in a statement: \u201cThe men and women serving the intelligence community safeguard U.S. national security by collecting information, conducting analysis, and providing intelligence for informed decision making under a strict set of laws, policies and guidelines. This mission protects our nation and others around the world.\u201d\nThe equipment at Menwith Hill covers roughly one square mile, which is patrolled 24 hours a day by armed British military police and monitored by cameras perched on posts that peer down on almost every section of the 10-foot perimeter fence.\nMost visible from the outside are a cluster of about 30 of the giant white domes. But the site also houses a self-contained community, accessible only to those with security clearance. Among operations buildings in which analysts listen in on monitored conversations, there is a bowling alley, a small pool hall, a bar, a fast food restaurant, and a general store.\nMost of the world\u2019s international phone calls, internet traffic, emails, and other communications are sent over a network of undersea cables that connect countries like giant arteries. At spy outposts across the world, the NSA and its partners tap into these cables to monitor the data flowing through them. But Menwith Hill is focused on a different kind of surveillance: eavesdropping on communications as they are being transmitted through the air.\nAccording to top-secret documents obtained by The Intercept from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, Menwith Hill has two main spying capabilities. The first is called FORNSAT, which uses powerful antennae contained within the golf ball-like domes to eavesdrop on communications as they are being beamed between foreign satellites. The second is called OVERHEAD, which uses U.S. government satellites orbiting above targeted countries to locate and monitor wireless communications on the ground below \u2014 such as cellphone calls and even WiFi traffic.\nIn the late 1980s, international communication networks were revolutionized by new fiber-optic undersea cables. The technology was cheaper than satellites and could transmit data across the world much faster than ever before, at almost the speed of light. For this reason, according to the NSA\u2019s documents, in the mid-1990s the U.S. intelligence community was convinced that satellite communications would soon become obsolete, to be fully replaced by fiber-optic cable networks.\nBut the prediction proved to be wrong. And millions of phone calls are still beamed between satellites today, alongside troves of internet data, which the NSA has readily exploited at Menwith Hill.\n\u201cThe commercial satellite communication business is alive and well and bursting at the seams with increasingly sophisticated bulk DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) traffic that is largely unencrypted,\u201d the NSA reported in a 2006 document. \u201cThis data source alone provides more data for Menwith Hill analysts to sift through than our entire enterprise had to deal with in the not-so-distant past.\u201d\nThe U.S. and U.K. governments have actively misled the public for years through a \u201ccover story.\u201d\nAs of 2009, Menwith Hill\u2019s foreign satellite surveillance mission, code-named MOONPENNY, was monitoring 163 different satellite data links. The intercepted communications were funneled into a variety of different repositories storing phone calls, content messages, emails, internet browsing histories, and other data.\nIt is not clear precisely how many communications Menwith Hill is capable of tapping into at any one time, but the NSA\u2019s documents indicate the number is extremely large. In a single 12-hour period in May 2011, for instance, its surveillance systems logged more than 335 million metadata records, which reveal information such as the sender and recipient of an email, or the phone numbers someone called and at what time.\nTo keep information about Menwith Hill\u2019s surveillance role secret, the U.S. and U.K. governments have actively misled the public for years through a \u201ccover story\u201d portraying the base as a facility used to provide \u201crapid radio relay and conduct communications research.\u201d A classified U.S. document, dated from 2005, cautioned spy agency employees against revealing the truth. \u201cIt is important to know the established cover story for MHS [Menwith Hill Station] and to protect the fact that MHS is an intelligence collection facility,\u201d the document stated. \u201cAny reference to satellites being operated or any connection to intelligence gathering is strictly prohibited.\u201d\nThe outpost was built in the 1950s as part of a deal made by the British and American governments to house U.S. personnel and surveillance equipment. In its early days, Menwith Hill\u2019s technology was much more primitive. According to Kenneth Bird, who worked at the base in the 1960s during the Cold War, it was focused then on monitoring high frequency radio signals in Eastern Europe. Intercepted conversations were recorded on Ampex tape recorders, Bird noted in his published 1997 account, with some transcribed by analysts in real-time using typewriters.\nThe modern Menwith Hill is a very different place. Now, not only are its spying systems capable of vacuuming up far more communications, but they also have a far broader geographic reach. In addition, the targets of the surveillance have drastically changed, as have the purposes for which the eavesdropping is carried out.\nThe documents obtained by The Intercept reveal that spy satellites operated at Menwith Hill today can target communications in China and Latin America, and also provide \u201ccontinuous coverage of the majority of the Eurasian landmass,\u201d where they intercept \u201ctactical military, scientific, political, and economic communications signals.\u201d But perhaps the most significant role the base has played in recent years has been in the Middle East and North Africa.\nEspecially in remote parts of the world where there are no fiber-optic cable links, it is common for internet connections and phone calls to be routed over satellite. Consequently, Menwith Hill became a vital asset in the U.S. government\u2019s counterterrorism campaign after the 9/11 attacks. Since then, the base has been used extensively to tap into communications in otherwise hard-to-reach areas where Islamic extremist groups such as al Qaeda and al Shabaab have been known to operate \u2014 for example, in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, Somalia, and Yemen.\nCrucially, however, Menwith Hill has been used for more than just gathering intelligence on people and governments across countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Surveillance tools such as the GHOSTHUNTER system were developed to directly aid military operations, pinpointing the locations of targeted people or groups so that they could then be captured or killed.\nThe NSA\u2019s documents describe GHOSTHUNTER as a means \u201cto locate targets when they log onto the internet.\u201d It was first developed in 2006 as \u201cthe only capability of its kind\u201d and it enabled \u201ca significant number of capture-kill operations\u201d against alleged terrorists. Only a few specific examples are given, but those cases give a remarkable insight into the extraordinary power of the technology.\nIn 2007, for instance, analysts at Menwith Hill used GHOSTHUNTER to help track down a suspected al Qaeda \u201cfacilitator\u201d in Lebanon who was described as \u201chighly actionable,\u201d meaning he had been deemed a legitimate target to kill or capture. The location of the target \u2014 who was known by several names, including Abu Sumayah \u2014 was traced to within a few hundred meters based on intercepts of his communications. Then a spy satellite took an aerial photograph of the neighborhood in Sidon, south Lebanon, in which he was believed to be living, mapping out the surrounding streets and houses. A top-secret document detailing the surveillance indicates that the information was to be passed to a secretive special operations unit known as Task Force 11-9, which would have been equipped to conduct a covert raid to kill or capture Sumayah. The outcome of the operation, however, is unclear, as it is not revealed in the document.\nIn another case in 2007, GHOSTHUNTER was used to identify an alleged al Qaeda \u201cweapons procurer\u201d in Iraq named Abu Sayf. The NSA\u2019s surveillance systems spotted Sayf logging into Yahoo email or messenger accounts at an internet cafe near a mosque in Anah, a town on the Euphrates River that is about 200 miles northwest of Baghdad. Analysts at Menwith Hill used GHOSTHUNTER to track down his location and spy satellites operated from the British base captured aerial images. This information was passed to U.S. military commanders based in Fallujah to be included as part of a \u201ctargeting plan.\u201d\nA few days later, a special operations unit named Task Force-16 stormed two properties, where they detained Sayf, his father, two brothers, and five associates.\nBy 2008, the apparent popularity of GHOSTHUNTER within the intelligence community meant that it was rolled out at other surveillance bases where NSA has a presence, including in Ayios Nikolaos, Cyprus, and Misawa, Japan. The expansion of the capability to the other bases meant that it now had \u201cnear-global coverage.\u201d But Menwith Hill remained its most important surveillance site. \u201c[Menwith Hill] still supplies about 99% of the FORNSAT data used in GHOSTHUNTER geolocations,\u201d noted a January 2008 document about the program.\nA 2009 document added that GHOSTHUNTER\u2019s focus was at that time \u201con geolocation of internet caf\u00e9s in the Middle East/North Africa region in support of U.S. military operations\u201d and said that it had to date \u201csuccessfully geolocated over 5,000 VSAT terminals in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran.\u201d VSAT, or Very Small Aperture Terminal, is a satellite system commonly used by internet caf\u00e9s and foreign governments in the Middle East to send and receive communications and data. GHOSTHUNTER could also home in on VSATs in Pakistan, Somalia, Algeria, the Philippines, Mali, Kenya, and Sudan, the documents indicate.\nMenwith Hill\u2019s unique ability to track down satellite devices across the world at times placed it on the front line of conflicts thousands of miles away. In Afghanistan, for instance, analysts at the base used the VSAT surveillance to help track down suspected members of the Taliban, which led to \u201capproximately 30 enemy killed\u201d during one series of attacks that were mentioned in a top-secret July 2011 report. In early 2012, Menwith Hill\u2019s analysts were again called upon to track down a VSAT: this time, to assist British special forces in Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand Province. The terminal was swiftly located, and within an hour an MQ-9 Reaper drone was dispatched to the area, presumably to launch an airstrike.\nBut the lethal use of the surveillance data does not appear to have been restricted to conventional war zones such as Afghanistan or Iraq. The NSA developed similar methods at Menwith Hill to track down terror suspects in Yemen, where the U.S. has waged a covert drone war against militants associated with al Qaeda in the Northern Peninsula.\nIn early 2010, the agency revealed in an internal report that it had launched a new technique at the British base to identify many targets \u201cat almost 40 different geolocated internet caf\u00e9s\u201d in Yemen\u2019s Shabwah province and in the country\u2019s capital, Sanaa. The technique, the document revealed, was linked to a broader classified initiative called GHOSTWOLF, described as a project to \u201ccapture or eliminate key nodes in terrorist networks\u201d by focusing primarily on \u201cproviding actionable geolocation intelligence derived from [surveillance] to customers and their operational components.\u201d\nThe description of GHOSTWOLF ties Menwith Hill to lethal operations in Yemen, providing the first documentary evidence that directly implicates the U.K. in covert actions in the country.\nMenwith Hill\u2019s previously undisclosed role aiding the so-called targeted killing of terror suspects highlights the extent of the British government\u2019s apparent complicity in controversial U.S. attacks \u2014 and raises questions about the legality of the secret operations carried out from the base.\nThere are some 2,200 personnel at Menwith Hill, the majority of whom are Americans. Alongside NSA employees within the complex, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office also has a major presence at the site, running its own \u201cground station\u201d from which it controls a number of spy satellites.\nBut the British government has publicly asserted as recently as 2014 that operations at the base \u201chave always been, and continue to be\u201d carried out with its \u201cknowledge and consent.\u201d Moreover, roughly 600 of the personnel at the facility are from U.K. agencies, including employees of the NSA\u2019s British counterpart Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.\nFor several years, British human rights campaigners and lawmakers have been pressuring the government to provide information about whether it has had any role aiding U.S. targeted killing operations, yet they have been met with silence. In particular, there has been an attempt to establish whether the U.K. has aided U.S. drone bombings outside of declared war zones \u2014 in countries including Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia \u2014 which have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and are in some cases considered by United Nations officials to possibly constitute war crimes and violations of international law.\nThough the Snowden documents analyzed by The Intercept state that Menwith Hill has aided \u201ca significant number\u201d of \u201ccapture-kill\u201d operations, they do not reveal specific details about all of the incidents that resulted in fatalities. What is clear, however, is that the base has targeted countries such as Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia as part of location-tracking programs like GHOSTHUNTER and GHOSTWOLF \u2014 which were created to help pinpoint individuals so they could be captured or killed \u2014 suggesting it has played a part in drone strikes in these countries.\n\u201cAn individual involved in passing that information is likely to be an accessory to murder.\u201d\nCraig, the legal director at Reprieve, reviewed the Menwith Hill documents \u2014 and said that they indicated British complicity in covert U.S. drone attacks. \u201cFor years, Reprieve and others have sought clarification from the British government about the role of U.K. bases in the U.S. covert drone program, which has killed large numbers of civilians in countries where we are not at war,\u201d she told The Intercept. \u201cWe were palmed off with platitudes and reassured that any U.S. activities on or involving British bases were fully compliant with domestic and international legal provisions. It now appears that this was far from the truth.\u201d\nJemima Stratford QC, a leading British human rights lawyer, told The Intercept that there were \u201cserious questions to be asked and serious arguments to be made\u201d about the legality of the lethal operations aided from Menwith Hill. The operations, Stratford said, could have violated the European Convention on Human Rights, an international treaty that the U.K. still remains bound to despite its recent vote to leave the European Union. Article 2 of the Convention protects the \u201cright to life\u201d and states that \u201cno one shall be deprived of his life intentionally\u201d except when it is ordered by a court as a punishment for a crime.\nStratford has previously warned that if British officials have facilitated covert U.S. drone strikes outside of declared war zones, they could even be implicated in murder. In 2014, she advised members of the U.K. Parliament that because the U.S. is not at war with countries such as Yemen or Pakistan, in the context of English and international law, the individuals who are targeted by drones in these countries are not \u201ccombatants\u201d and their killers are not entitled to \u201ccombatant immunity.\u201d\n\u201cIf the U.K. government knows that it is transferring data that may be used for drone strikes against non-combatants \u2026 that transfer is probably unlawful,\u201d Stratford told the members of Parliament. \u201cAn individual involved in passing that information is likely to be an accessory to murder.\u201d\nGCHQ refused to answer questions for this story, citing a \u201clong standing policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters.\u201d A spokesperson for the agency issued a generic statement asserting that \u201call of GCHQ\u2019s work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.\u201d The spokesperson insisted that \u201cU.K.\u2019s interception regime is entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201d\nIn February 2014, the U.S. Department of Defense announced after a review that it was planning to reduce personnel at Menwith Hill by 2016, with about 500 service members and civilians set to be removed from the site. A U.S. Air Force spokesperson told the military newspaper Stars and Stripes that the decision was based on technological advances, which he declined to discuss, though he mentioned improvements in \u201cserver capacity to the hardware that we\u2019re using; we\u2019re doing more with less.\u201d\nThe documents provided by Snowden shine light on some of the specific technological changes. Most notably, they show that there has been significant investment in introducing new and more sophisticated mass surveillance systems at Menwith Hill in recent years. A crucial moment came in 2008, when then-NSA Director Keith Alexander introduced a radical shift in policy. Visiting Menwith Hill in June that year, Alexander set a challenge for employees at the base. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we collect all the signals, all the time?\u201d he said, according to NSA documents. \u201cSounds like a good summer homework project for Menwith.\u201d\nAs a result, a new \u201ccollection posture\u201d was introduced at the base, the aim being to \u201ccollect it all, process it all, exploit it all.\u201d In other words, it would vacuum up as many communications within its reach as technologically possible.\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Menwith Hill spent more than $40 million on a massive new 95,000-square-foot operations building \u2014 nearly twice the size of an average American football field. A large chunk of this space \u2014 10,000 square feet \u2014 was set aside for a data center that boasted the ability to store huge troves of intercepted communications. During the renovations, the NSA shipped in new computer systems and laid 182 miles of cables, enough to stretch from New York City to the outskirts of Boston. The agency also had a 200-seat-capacity auditorium constructed to host classified operations meetings and other events.\n\u201cHow can Menwith carry out operations of which there is absolutely no accountability to the public?\u201d\nSome of the extensive expansion work was visible from the road outside the secure complex, which triggered protests from a local activist group called the Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases. Since the early 1990s, the group has closely monitored activities at Menwith Hill. And for the last 16 years, its members have held a small demonstration every Tuesday outside the base\u2019s main entrance, greeting NSA employees with flags and colorful homemade banners bearing slogans critical of U.S. foreign policy and drone strikes.\nFabian Hamilton, a member of Parliament based in the nearby city of Leeds, has become a supporter of the campaign\u2019s work, occasionally attending events organized by the group and advocating for more transparency at Menwith Hill. Hamilton, who represents the Labour Party, has doggedly attempted to find out basic information about the base, asking the government at least 40 parliamentary questions since 2010 about its activities. He has sought clarification on a variety of issues, such as how many U.S. personnel are stationed at the site, whether it is involved in conducting drone strikes, and whether members of a British parliamentary oversight committee have been given full access to review its operations. But his efforts have been repeatedly stonewalled, with British government officials refusing to provide any details on the grounds of national security.\nHamilton told The Intercept that he found the secrecy shrouding Menwith Hill to be \u201coffensive.\u201d The revelations about the role it has played in U.S. killing and capture operations, he said, showed there needed to be a full review of its operations. \u201cAny nation-state that uses military means to attack any target, whether it is a terrorist, whether it is legitimate or not, has to be accountable to its electorate for what it does,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThat\u2019s the basis of our Parliament, it\u2019s the basis of our whole democratic system. How can we say that Menwith can carry out operations of which there is absolutely no accountability to the public? I don\u2019t buy this idea that you say the word \u2018security\u2019 and nobody can know anything. We need to know what is being done in our name.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nDocuments published with this article:\n- Elegant Chaos: collect it all, exploit it all\n- Elegant Chaos: collect it all, exploit it all (plus notes)\n- Ghosthunter: only capability of its kind\n- Menwith satellite classification guide\n- UK special forces Reaper drone (Jan-Feb-2012)\n- Afghanistan 30 enemy killed (Jan-Feb 2012)\n- Project Sandstorm wifi geolocation (Jan 2011)\n- Yemen backhaul comms collected (Jan 2011)\n- New ops building at Menwith completed, fit up begins\n- New technique geolocates targets active at Yemeni cafes\n- Work is progressing on Menwith Hill Station\u2019s new operations building\n- Ghosthunter and the geolocating of internet cafes\n- Traffic series: is your collection surveyed or sustained\n- APPARITION becomes a reality new corporate VSAT geolocation capability sees its first deployment\n- Ghosthunter goes global\n- Menwith continues successful counterterrorism survey along Af-Pak border\n- SIGINT target package leads to USMC capture of al Qaeda weapons procurer\n- Too much of a good thing?\n- Menwith initiatives maximizing our access\n- GSM tower mapping made easier and more accurate with new tool\n- Ghosthunter future capabilities (2008)\n- New tool combines multi agency databases for complete target snapshot\n- GSM tower geolocation\n- Menwith collection assets\n- Menwith databases as of Aug 2008\n- Ghosthunter tasking process\n- Apparition/Ghosthunter tasking info",

    "title": "The Unrelenting Pundit-Led Effort to Delegitimize All Negative Reporting About Hillary Clinton",
    "content": "In his New York Times column yesterday, Paul Krugman did something that he made clear he regarded as quite brave: He defended the Democratic Party presidential nominee and likely next U.S. president from journalistic investigations. Complaining about media bias, Krugman claimed that journalists are driven by \u201cthe presumption that anything Hillary Clinton does must be corrupt, most spectacularly illustrated by the increasingly bizarre coverage of the Clinton Foundation.\u201d While generously acknowledging that it was legitimate to take a look at the billions of dollars raised by the Clintons as Hillary pursued increasing levels of political power \u2014 vast sums often received from the very parties most vested in her decisions as a public official \u2014 it is now \u201cvery clear,\u201d he proclaimed, that there was absolutely nothing improper about any of what she or her husband did.\nKrugman\u2019s column, chiding the media for its unfairly negative coverage of his beloved candidate, was, predictably, a big hit among Democrats \u2014 not just because of their agreement with its content but because of what they regarded as the remarkable courage required to publicly defend someone as marginalized and besieged as the former first lady, two-term New York senator, secretary of state, and current establishment-backed multimillionaire presidential front-runner. Krugman \u2014 in a tweet proclamation that has now been re-tweeted more than 10,000 times \u2014 heralded himself this way: \u201cI was reluctant to write today\u2019s column because I knew journos would hate it. But it felt like a moral duty.\u201d\nTrue fact: I was reluctant to write today's col because I knew journos would hate it. But it felt like a moral duty https://t.co/ldee224frl\n\u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) September 5, 2016\nAs my colleague Zaid Jilani remarked: \u201cI can imagine Paul Krugman standing in front of the mirror saying, \u2018This is *your Tahrir Square* big guy.\u2019\u201d Nate Silver, early yesterday morning, even suggested that Krugman\u2019s Clinton-defending column was so edgy and threatening that the New York Times \u2014 which published the column \u2014 was effectively suppressing Krugman\u2019s brave stance by refusing to promote it on Twitter (the NYT tweeted Krugman\u2019s column a few hours later, early in the afternoon). Thankfully, it appears that Krugman \u2014 at least thus far \u2014 has suffered no governmental recriminations or legal threats, nor any career penalties, for his intrepid, highly risky defense of Hillary Clinton.\nThat\u2019s because \u2014 in contrast to his actually brave, orthodoxy-defying work in 2002 as one of the few media voices opposed to the invasion of Iraq, for which he deserves eternal credit \u2014 Krugman here is doing little more than echoing conventional media wisdom. That prominent journalists are overwhelmingly opposed to Donald Trump is barely debatable; their collective contempt for him is essentially out in the open, which is where it should be. Contrary to Krugman\u2019s purported expectation, countless Clinton-supporting journalists rushed to express praise for Krugman. Indeed, with very few exceptions, U.S. elites across the board \u2014 from both parties, spanning multiple ideologies \u2014 are aligned with unprecedented unity against Donald Trump. The last thing required to denounce him, or to defend Hillary Clinton, is bravery.\nThat wasn\u2019t true at first: For a long time, journalists refused to take the dangers posed by Trump\u2019s campaign seriously. In March 2016, I wrote a column denouncing the U.S. media for venerating feigned neutrality over its responsibility to sound the alarm about how extremist and menacing Trump\u2019s candidacy really is. But in the last few months, Trump\u2019s media portrayal has been overwhelmingly (and justifiably) negative; his shady business scams have been endlessly investigated and dissected (often on the front page of the NYT); he and his surrogates are subjected to remarkably (and fairly) harsh interviews; his pathological lying has been unequivocally chronicled by numerous media outlets; and few journalists have suppressed their horror at his most extremist policies. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Tom Gara put it last month: \u201cMy Twitter timeline is now just a continuous rolling denunciation of Donald Trump.\u201d\nNew gold standard for TV news: Fact-checking Trump while he speaks. @CNN pic.twitter.com/kFCac0rjHD\n\u2014 Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) June 2, 2016\nThat American journalists have dispensed with muted tones and fake neutrality when reporting on Trump is a positive development. He and his rhetoric pose genuine threats, and the U.S. media would be irresponsible if it failed to make that clear. But aggressive investigative journalism against Trump is not enough for Democratic partisans whose voice is dominant in U.S. media discourse. They also want a cessation of any news coverage that reflects negatively on Hillary Clinton. Most, of course, won\u2019t say this explicitly (though some do), but \u2014 as the wildly adored Krugman column from yesterday reflects \u2014 they will just reflexively dismiss any such coverage as illegitimate and invalid.\nIt should be the opposite of surprising, or revealing, that pundits loyally devoted to a particular candidate dislike all reporting that reflects negatively on that candidate. There is probably no more die-hard Clinton loyalist in the U.S. media than Paul Krugman. He has used his column for years to defend her and attack any of her critics. Indeed, in 2008, he was the first to observe that \u2014 in his words \u2014 \u201cthe Obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality,\u201d comparing the adulation Clinton\u2019s 2008 primary opponent was receiving to the swooning over George W. Bush\u2019s flight suit. He spent the 2016 primary maligning Sanders supporters as unstable, unserious losers (the straight, white, male columnist also regularly referred to them \u2014 including female and LGBT Sanders supporters \u2014 as \u201cbros\u201d). And now he\u2019s assigned himself the role as Arbiter of Proper Journalism, and \u2014 along with virtually all other Clinton-supporting pundits and journalists \u2014 has oh-so-surprisingly ruled that all journalism that reflects poorly on Hillary Clinton is unsubstantiated, biased, and deceitful.\nThe absolute last metric journalists should use for determining what to cover is the reaction of pundits who, like Krugman and plenty of others, are singularly devoted to the election of one of the candidates. Of course Hillary Clinton\u2019s die-hard loyalists in the media will dislike, and find invalid, any suggestion that she engaged in any sort of questionable conduct. Their self-assigned role is to defend her from all criticisms. They view themselves more as campaign operatives than journalists: Their principal, overriding goal is to ensure that Clinton wins the election. They will obviously hate anything \u2014 particularly negative reporting about her \u2014 that conflicts with that goal. They will jettison even their core stated beliefs \u2014 such as the view that big-money donations corrupt politicians \u2014 in order to fulfill that goal.\nBut it would be journalistic malpractice of the highest order if the billions of dollars received by the Clintons \u2014 both personally and though their various entities \u2014 were not rigorously scrutinized and exposed in detail by reporters. That\u2019s exactly what they ought to be doing. The fact that quid pro quos cannot be definitively proven does not remotely negate the urgency of this journalism. That\u2019s because quid pro quos by their nature elude such proof (can anyone prove that Republicans steadfastly support Israel and low taxes because of the millions they get from Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers, or that the Florida attorney general decided not to prosecute Trump because his foundation and his daughter donated to her?). Beyond quid quo pros, the Clintons\u2019 constant, pioneering merger of massive private wealth and political power and influence is itself highly problematic. Nobody forced them to take millions of dollars from the Saudis and Goldman Sachs tycoons and corporations with vested interests in the State Department; having chosen to do so with great personal benefit, they are now confronting the consequences in how the public views such behavior.\nThat Donald Trump is an uber-nationalist, bigotry-exploiting demagogue and unstable extremist does not remotely entitle Hillary Clinton to waltz into the Oval Office free of aggressive journalistic scrutiny. Nor does Trump\u2019s extremism constitute a defense to anything that she\u2019s done. It is absolutely true that Trump has at least as many troublesome financial transactions and entangling relationships as the Clintons do: These donations to the Florida attorney general are among the most corrupt-appearing transactions yet documented. Even worse, Trump has shielded himself from much needed scrutiny by inexcusably refusing to release his tax returns, while much of the reporting about the Clintons is possible only because they have released theirs. All of that is important and should be highlighted.\nBut none of it suggests that anything other than a bright journalistic light is appropriate for examining the Clintons\u2019 conduct. Yet there are prominent pundits and journalists who literally denounce every critical report about Clinton as unfair and deceitful, and band together to malign the reporters who scrutinize the Clintons\u2019 financial transactions. Those prominent voices combine with the million-dollar online army that supreme sleaze merchant David Brock has assembled to attack Clinton critics; as the Los Angeles Times reported in May: \u201cClinton\u2019s well-heeled backers have opened a new frontier in digital campaigning, one that seems to have been inspired by some of the internet\u2019s worst instincts. Correct the Record, a Super PAC coordinating with Clinton\u2019s campaign, is spending some $1 million to find and confront social media users who post unflattering messages about the Democratic front-runner.\u201d\nAll of this means that any journalists reporting negatively on Clinton are instantly and widely bombarded with criticisms denouncing their work as illegitimate, as they\u2019ve started noting:\nClinton backers' shaming of the press for reporting anything the Clinton campaign dislikes is rapidly approaching self-parody territory.\n\u2014 Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 4, 2016\nhttps://twitter.com/jbarro/status/770948798667452417\nNo one in the media should do another story remotely questioning anything Hillary has done until the NYT accuses Trump of bribery on Page 1.\n\u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) September 6, 2016\nSo little upset here at Clintons for decisions like taking $18 million from for-profit college. Only upset at press for daring to point out.\n\u2014 Alec MacGillis (@AlecMacGillis) September 6, 2016\nOr just look at the outrage directed last night at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman \u2014 who has written story after story investigating Donald Trump \u2014 for the crime of innocuously noting a Washington Post story about Bill Clinton\u2019s multimillion-dollar payday for a largely no-show job from a for-profit college:\nWell-reported deep dive into @billclinton multi-million-dollar honorary chancellor role with Laureate https://t.co/EHNrVnv89i\n\u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 6, 2016\nIt\u2019s very common for political factions to believe that they\u2019re persecuted and victimized. Even with the overwhelming bulk of the national media so openly aligned against Trump \u2014 with an endless array of investigative stories showing Trump to be an unscrupulous con artist and pathological liar \u2014 Clinton supporters seem to genuinely believe that the media is actually biased against their candidate.\nThe reality is that large, pro-Clinton liberal media platforms \u2014 such as Vox, and the Huffington Post, and prime-time MSNBC programs, and the columnists and editorialists of the New York Times and the Washington Post, and most major New York-based weekly magazines \u2014 have been openly campaigning for Hillary Clinton. I don\u2019t personally see anything wrong with that \u2014 I\u2019m glad when journalists shed their faux objectivity; I believe the danger of Trump\u2019s candidacy warrants that; and I hope this candor continues past the November election \u2014 but the everyone-is-against-us self-pity from Clinton partisans is just a joke. They are the dominant voices in elite media discourse, and it\u2019s a big reason why Clinton is highly likely to win.\nThat\u2019s all the more reason why journalists should be subjecting Clinton\u2019s financial relationships, associations, and secret communications to as much scrutiny as Donald Trump\u2019s. That certainly does not mean that journalists should treat their various sins and transgressions as equivalent: Nothing in the campaign compares to Trump\u2019s deport-11-million-people or ban-all-Muslim policies, or his attacks on a judge for his Mexican ethnicity, etc. But this emerging narrative that Clinton should not only enjoy the support of a virtually united elite class but also a scrutiny-free march into the White House is itself quite dangerous. Clinton partisans in the media \u2014 including those who regard themselves as journalists \u2014 will continue to reflexively attack all reporting that reflects negatively on her, but that reporting should nonetheless continue with unrestrained aggression.",

    "title": "White House Report Concludes That Bite-Mark Analysis Is Junk Science",
    "content": "The President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has concluded that forensic bite-mark evidence is not scientifically valid and is unlikely ever to be validated, according to a draft report obtained by The Intercept. The report, titled \u201cForensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods,\u201d is marked as a \u201cpredecisional\u201d draft created August 26 that is not to be quoted or distributed, though the title page suggests the report will be made public sometime this month.\nThe report reviews a handful of common forensic practices, so called feature-comparison disciplines, or pattern-matching practices \u2014 bite-mark analysis, fingerprint and firearm analysis, shoe tread analysis, and DNA mixture analysis \u2014 each of which involves an \u201cexpert\u201d looking at a piece of evidence and eyeballing whether it matches a particular image, person, or object. The report discusses whether each practice has been scientifically validated, what it would take to do so, and how each practice should be used in the courtroom \u2014 if at all.\nIn the case of bite-mark evidence, the report is especially critical. \u201cPCAST finds that bitemark analysis does not meet the scientific standards for foundational validity, and is far from meeting such standards,\u201d it reads. \u201cTo the contrary, available scientific evidence strongly suggests that examiners cannot consistently agree on whether an injury is a human bitemark and cannot identify the source of [a] bitemark with reasonable accuracy.\u201d\nBite-mark analysis is conducted by forensic dentists and relies on two foundational premises: first, that human dentition is unique \u2014 as unique as DNA \u2014 and second, that human skin (or another malleable substrate) is a suitable medium on which to record such an impression. The problem is that neither premise has been proved. Nonetheless, bite-mark analysis has been used in criminal cases to match individuals to alleged bites since the 1950s, when Texas\u2019s highest criminal court cleared the way for its use (in that case, a dentist claimed that a bite mark left in a piece of cheese found at the scene of a grocery burglary matched the teeth of a particular man).\nAlthough bite-mark matching is nowhere near as ubiquitous as, say, fingerprint analysis in the criminal justice system, it has left a string of victims in its wake. To date, 25 wrongful arrests or convictions have been linked to bite-mark analysis and additional cases are still pending in the courts, according to the Innocence Project. In June, Bill Richards was freed from prison after spending nearly 23 years behind bars for the murder of his wife in California based on the erroneous testimony of a forensic dentist who said a wound found on his wife Pamela\u2019s hand was a match to Richards\u2019s supposedly unusual dentition.\nDespite their poor track record, many forensic dentists \u2014 most associated with the American Board of Forensic Odontology, the discipline\u2019s certifying body \u2014 have remained rabidly defensive of their practice and the notion that it is a righteous undertaking that helps put criminals behind bars. An integral part of their defense has been to lash out at critics \u2014even those among their own ranks. The group unsuccessfully tried to expel Dr. C. Michael Bowers from the American Academy of Forensic Sciences \u2014 the nation\u2019s preeminent umbrella organization for forensic practitioners \u2014 on a trumped-up ethics charge. And they have attacked both professionally and personally Dr. Mary Bush and her husband, Peter, who have conducted significant research demonstrating the practice\u2019s lack of a scientific underpinning. Notably, the PCAST report gives a distinct nod to the Bushes\u2019 work in determining that there is no actual science behind bite-mark analysis.\nWhile the report acknowledges the dentists\u2019 concern that excluding bite-mark evidence \u201ccould hamper efforts to convict criminals in some cases,\u201d it rejects the idea that this alone is sufficient to warrant the practice. If the dentists\u2019 concerns are valid, \u201cthe correct solution, from a scientific perspective, would not be to admit expert testimony based on invalid and unreliable methods, but rather to attempt to develop scientifically valid methods,\u201d it reads. \u201cHowever, PCAST considers the prospects of developing bitemark analysis into a scientifically valid method to be low. We advise against devoting significant resources to such efforts.\u201d\nPattern Matching, Subjectivity, and Junk Science\nPresident Obama created the advisory council in 2009 as a means of gathering scientific input that could impact policy decisions. Although the practice of presidents naming scientific advisers dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, the timing of the creation of Obama\u2019s council was particularly notable, coming just roughly two months after the release of a groundbreaking report from the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council, which cast a long shadow over a host of pattern-matching forensic disciplines that have been used for decades in criminal cases. That report \u2014 \u201cStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward\u201d \u2014 noted a lack of scientific underpinning in nearly every forensic practice, except for DNA, and called for research to be done to shore up the disciplines.\nIn the wake of the NAS report, the government has taken action \u2014 a National Commission on Forensic Science was created, and a number of scientific working groups have undertaken the arduous task of coordinating the development of standards and guidelines for various forensic disciplines. PCAST was asked by Obama in September 2015 to see what additional efforts might be undertaken to aid the effort to instill science into forensics. Upon review, PCAST concluded \u201cthat the most useful contribution it could make would be to add clarity on the scientific meaning of \u2018reliable principles and methods\u2019 and \u2018scientific validity\u2019 in the context of certain forensic disciplines.\u201d\nScientific validity and reliability mandate that each method be subjected to empirical testing in order to determine meaningful error rates. \u201cWithout appropriate estimates of accuracy, an examiner\u2019s statement that two samples are similar \u2014 or even indistinguishable \u2014 is scientifically meaningless: it has no probative value and considerable potential for prejudicial impact,\u201d reads the report. \u201cNothing \u2014 not training, personal experience nor professional practices \u2014 can substitute for adequate empirical demonstration of accuracy.\u201d\nTo be fair, bite-mark analysis is not the only practice criticized by PCAST. Fingerprint matching has only recently been put to rigorous testing (it is \u201cdistressing\u201d that it has taken so long to do so, the report notes), and two such studies produced high error rates \u2014 in one, an error rate of 1 in 18 was found, in the other 1 in 306. The report recommends that jurors be informed of the studies and their results.\nWhere firearm analysis is concerned, the group notes early studies indicate that examiners can, \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d connect spent ammunition to the gun from which it was fired, but also reports that just one appropriate study has so far been conducted and that other \u201cfrequently cited studies seriously underestimate the false positive rate.\u201d Importantly, for both fingerprints and firearms analysis, the group writes that transforming the practice from a subjective one to an objective one is preferable, by automating the disciplines through \u201cmachine learning\u201d image analysis.\nRegarding footwear analysis \u2014 matching a shoe tread pattern left at a crime scene to a particular shoe based on \u201crandomly acquired characteristics,\u201d such as cuts and gouges on a shoe\u2019s sole \u2014 the PCAST finds that there are no studies that demonstrate the practice is based on actual science. \u201cSuch conclusions are unsupported by any meaningful evidence or estimates of their accuracy and thus are not scientifically valid.\u201d\nAnd while PCAST finds that single-source and simple mixture DNA analysis rests firmly on a scientific foundation, the analysis of complex mixtures requires more validation. Complex mixtures involve DNA samples with two or more unknown sources and result in a profile that \u201csuperimposes multiple individual DNA profiles.\u201d In such cases, an analyst has to visually inspect the results and make a subjective determination about whether a particular suspect is present in the sample. And that determination can become clouded by outside knowledge of the particular case at hand, the report notes. The creation of \u201cprobabilistic genotyping software\u201d and the testing of such software would go a long way to curing the problem. (The PCAST report notes that there are problems associated with other forensic practices it has not reviewed \u2014 singling out cases of alleged arson and prosecutions based on shaken baby syndrome \u2014 that also \u201crequire urgent attention.\u201d)\nPredictably, reaction to the draft report by the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) was swift. On September 2 \u2014 the day after the PCAST reportedly voted to approve it \u2014 the group issued a press release blasting the PCAST \u2014 and, seemingly missing the point the PCAST is trying to make. \u201cThe forensic disciplines that the PCAST authors attack are (and have been) reliably used every day by investigators, prosecutors, and defense attorneys across the United States to aid in both exonerating the innocent and convicting the guilty,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cThe PCAST position regarding the use of forensic science is scientifically irresponsible. Adopting any of their recommendations would have a devastating effect on the ability of law enforcement, prosecutors and the defense bar to fully investigate their cases, exclude innocent suspects, implicate the guilty and achieve true justice at trial.\u201d\nNDAA president Mike Ramos, the elected district attorney in San Bernardino County, California, said that the NDAA will \u201ccontinue to serve the citizens of this great nation\u201d in part by defending the criminal justice system \u201cagainst those who would seek to undermine\u201d it.\nNotably, it was under Ramos\u2019s leadership that Bill Richards was wrongfully convicted of his wife\u2019s murder; his office tried Richards three times before finally getting a conviction, and did so only after the questionable bite-mark evidence was introduced. After the California Supreme Court in late May threw out that conviction, which it determined was based on junk science, Ramos\u2019s office made it clear to defense attorneys that they would seek to try Richards again. Ultimately, Ramos\u2019s office dismissed the case, and Richards was finally freed.\n\u201cAs a man who lost his life behind the false science of bite marks, I feel the proposed action of eliminating its use in the courtroom is long overdue,\u201d Richards wrote in an email to The Intercept. \u201cThe desire to \u2026 convict appears to blind experts who don\u2019t consider that some defendants are innocent. No subjective \u2018science\u2019 should be used in any courtroom. The witch hunt mentality takes over and they find matches that are not there, sending innocent people to prison.\u201d",

And then Saddam Hussein would do the gas. And somebody else would do something else. And they\u2019d rest.\u201d\nClinton, on the other hand, focused her remarks on issues like college affordability and small businesses.\nFox, CNN, and MSNBC responded by giving almost all of their attention to Trump.\nThe networks started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks at around 2:15 p.m. ET.

    "title": "Inside the Mind of James Clapper",
    "content": "I\u2019m going to have a story published later today about a new document, but until then, this new interview with (and profile of) Director of National Intelligence James Clapper by the Daily Beast\u2018s Eli Lake is worth spending a few moments examining. Last week, Lake published one excerpt of his interview where Clapper admitted that the U.S. Government should have told the American people that the NSA was collecting their communications records: as pure a vindication of Edward Snowden\u2019s choice as it gets, for obvious reasons. But there are several new, noteworthy revelations from this morning\u2019s article:\nThanks to rogue contractor Edward Snowden, the machinations of the shadow bureaucracy Clapper heads have for the last eight months been exposed one news story at a time. Clapper is often the guy who has to call newspaper editors to tell them not to print stories that they usually publish anyway.\nThis process of pre-publication notice to the government of NSA stories has been wildly misreported in some places. I\u2019ve long expressed contempt for this process where it results in the suppression of information that should be public; where it essentially elevates U.S. officials into publication partners by engaging in protracted \u201cnegotiations\u201d with them over what can and cannot be published; and especially where it means news organizations knowingly allow government officials to lie by withholding the actual facts.\nFor all the NSA stories published over the last eight months all around the world, the U.S. government was notified prior to publication (usually very shortly prior) by the news organizations\u2019 editors (never, to my knowledge, by the journalists, at least not by me). News organizations do this for two reasons.\nThe first is legal: the U.S. Government insists that the publication of classified information, especially that which relates to \u201ccommunications intelligence\u201d, is a felony (see 18 U.S \u00a7 798), so every media lawyer vehemently argues that allowing the government an opportunity to make the case for why something shouldn\u2019t be published is necessary to show a lack of criminal intent, i.e., to avoid criminal prosecution even while publishing top secret documents; the other is journalistic: it makes sense that journalists making choices about what to publish and what to say about documents would want more, rather than less, information when deciding.\nI can\u2019t speak for what The Washington Post or New York Times have done, but for the NSA articles on which I\u2019ve worked \u2013 at the Guardian and with more than a dozen media outlets around the world \u2013 the government has argued in most cases that the story and accompanying documents should not be published. And in almost every single case \u2013 99% if not more \u2013 those arguments have been rejected in their entirety and the stories and documents were published anyway. In fact, for the dozens and dozens of stories and documents on which I\u2019ve worked, I can only recall a single case where anything the government said resulted in anything being withheld that we had decided to publish, and that was a trivial aspect of one part of one document which, unbeknownst to us, could have revealed the identity of an NSA employee (the Guardian and New York Times, without my involvement, both withheld some details on their story about NSA/GCHQ compromising of encryption standards, though primarily \u2013 as I understand it \u2013 because publishing the handful of compromised standards we knew about would mislead people into believing the other compromised standards (the vast majority of which weren\u2019t revealed by the documents) were safe).\nIn every single other case, the government\u2019s arguments for non-publication were rejected, usually because they were vague and unpersuasive. So while it\u2019s true that the government\u2019s input has been permitted prior to publication \u2013 just as journalists seek the input of anyone about which they\u2019re writing \u2013 Lake is correct that in most cases (in my experience, almost all) that official input demanding suppression was rejected, exactly as it should have been.\nTo this day the U.S. government doesn\u2019t know the full extent of what Snowden revealed or whether more documents that have yet to be published in the press have made their way into the hands of Russian or Chinese intelligence agencies.\nIt\u2019s been rather amazing to watch not only the standard roster of government-loyal American journalists, but also those who fancy themselves some sort of cynical critics, uncritically regurgitate the government\u2019s evidence-free assertion that Snowden took and then gave to journalists 1.7 million documents. It amazes me because: (1) anyone at this point who is willing to equate evidence-free government assertions with Truth is drowning in some extreme levels of authoritarianism, by definition; and (2) the government clearly has no idea what Snowden took, as report after report has made crystal clear.\nCovering nearly an entire wall of the waiting area outside Clapper\u2019s office is a wooden relief sculpture dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. It contains a flag, a rendition of the constitutional assembly, and a copy of the document itself. It also has a plaque that reads, \u201cWhat is the magic of the Constitution? The magic is how it states: We, the people. For the first time in history, government was about the people, not about the leader.\u201d\nYes, that\u2019s right: James Clapper has converted the wall outside of his office into a flamboyant homage to the very same U.S. Constitution that he vandalizes on a daily basis. That is the greatest act of either deliberately overt contempt for the public or pathological self-delusion since Barack Obama advocated a legalized system of \u201cpreventive detention\u201d in 2009 while he stood in front of the U.S. Constitution at the National Archive. Someone may want to explain to Clapper that a primary impetus for that Constitution, and for the American Revolution generally, was hatred of the King\u2019s \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d whereby people could be subject to searches without a whiff of evidence of wrongdoing.\nClapper also acknowledges that the very human nature of the bureaucracy he controls virtually insures that more mass disclosures are inevitable. \u201cIn the end,\u201d he says, \u201cwe will never ever be able to guarantee that there will not be an Edward Snowden or another Chelsea Manning because this is a large enterprise composed of human beings with all their idiosyncrasies.\u201d\nThat is indeed true, and it\u2019s good news: more Chelsea Mannings and Edward Snowdens are inevitable, and there is nothing the U.S. Government can do to stop them. That\u2019s good news because it means government officials will have to operate on the assumption that what they do in the dark will become public (an excellent deterrent) and because that type of transparency is inherently healthy in a political culture where secrecy is rampant and the institutions designed to check it (Congress, the media, the federal judiciary) have all profoundly failed.\nThis also underscores why the U.S. Government has been so vindictive in trying to punish the likes of Manning and other whistleblowers. Since they have no means of preventing these sorts of leaks, their only hope is to create a climate of fear and intimidation: if you are thinking about exposing our bad acts, look at what we did to Chelsea Manning or Tom Drake and think twice. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been so vital \u2013 and, for the U.S. national security state, so devastating \u2013 that Edward Snowden has remained out of their grasp: rather than getting to parade him in front of the world in an orange jumpsuit and shackles, U.S. officials are forced to watch as he is hailed as an international hero, receives award after award, and participates freely in the debate he triggered. That, in turn, allows the template he used to be a positive one, one that will undoubtedly inspire future whistleblowers.\n[Democratic Sen. Ron] Wyden in a statement told The Daily Beast, \u201cIt\u2019s true that no one knows what is going through a witness\u2019s head when they are sitting at the witness table, other than the witness himself. Unfortunately, over the past several years a number of senior officials have repeatedly made misleading and inaccurate statements about domestic surveillance at congressional hearings and in other public settings.\u201d\nThe lie Clapper criminally told to the U.S. Senate in March, 2013 has received the bulk of attention, but as Wyden makes clear, NSA and other senior officials have been repeatedly lying about U.S. surveillance to the Congress, to courts, and in public over and over about all sorts of things. That\u2019s what makes the slavish equating by the U.S. media of \u201cunproven NSA claims\u201d with \u201ctruth\u201d so embarrassingly subservient and irrational. It\u2019s also what makes the eagerness of American journalists to demand Snowden\u2019s imprisonment \u2013 contrasted with their fear of doing the same for Clapper \u2013 such a powerful illustration of their true allegiances and function.\nOthers are less charitable. Last month Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian Republican from Kentucky, said if Snowden was to face justice, he should \u201cshare a jail cell with James Clapper\u201d for lying to Congress.\n\u201cWell Senator Paul says I should get to know [Snowden] by being in the same prison cell with him, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea,\u201d Clapper told The Daily Beast last week. \u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t be in Mr. Snowden\u2019s best interest.\u201d\nThis statement \u2013 half creepy prison fantasy and half threat \u2013 is unsurprising. The need for U.S. officials to publicly express a desire for violence when it comes to Snowden has asserted itself over and over.\nRecall how House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers and former CIA/NSA chief Mike Hayden \u201cjoked\u201d at a hearing that Snowden should be put on the U.S. government\u2019s \u201chit list\u201d and murdered. Last month, BuzzFeed quoted several anonymous Pentagon and intelligence community officials as they laid out their fantasies for how they would like to murder Snowden (\u201cGoing back to his flat and he is casually poked by a passerby. He thinks nothing of it at the time starts to feel a little woozy and thinks it\u2019s a parasite from the local water. He goes home very innocently and next thing you know he dies in the shower\u201d). Former CIA chief James Woolsey said \u201che should be hanged by his neck until he is dead\u201d if convicted of treason, while former UN Ambassador John Bolton revealed an even more detailed fantasy: \u201cMy view is that Snowden committed treason, he ought to be convicted of that, and then he ought to swing from a tall oak tree.\u201d\nNot only does this underscore the warped pathologies among the glorious leaders of America\u2019s National Security State, but it also highlights the inanity of believing that these kinds of people can and should be trusted with invasive spying powers to be exercised in the dark.\nThe charges against his integrity bother Clapper. \u201cI would rather not hear that or see that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough on my family, I will tell you that. My son is a high school teacher and he has a tendency, or he is getting over it, to internalize a lot of this.\u201d Those who know and have worked with Clapper also say it\u2019s unfair to call him dishonest. Rhodes said President Obama values Clapper because \u201che\u2019s a straight shooter who doesn\u2019t put any spin on the ball.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that President Obama regards a proven liar as a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d. That\u2019s the same President who regards torture-and-rendition-advocating John Brennan as his high moral priest when deciding who should be put on his \u201ckill list\u201d.\nBut what\u2019s remarkable here is the self-pity on display from Clapper. He\u2019s gone around the country over the last month branding journalists as \u201caccomplices\u201d for the crime of reporting on the NSA without the slightest regard for the effects that this thuggish behavior has on those journalists, their families, and the news-gathering process.\nBut what\u2019s even more amazing is that Clapper considers himself some sort of victim rather than what he is: the completely undeserving beneficiary of a system of \u201cjustice\u201d in which ordinary and powerless people are imprisoned for trivial offenses at greater numbers than any other nation in the world, while those who wield political power, like him, are free to commit crimes without even losing their powerful jobs, let alone being prosecuted for them. James Clapper should look in the mirror every morning and be extremely grateful for the corrupted political system that has shielded him from the consequences of his crimes even as he tries to criminalize others for doing things that the U.S. Constitution guarantees them the right to do.\nInstead, he sees himself as the victim. He has medals on his chest and an important national security state position. It is simply outrageous that some people suggest that he has no right to commit felonies, and it\u2019s infuriating that his adult son has to hear some people (almost none in the media) suggest that his criminal conduct should have the same consequences as when ordinary citizens commit less serious crimes. That\u2019s the refusal to accept any personal responsibility, the view of powerful U.S. officials that they are and must be entirely above the law, the obsessive self-regard, that more than anything else has destroyed Washington\u2019s political culture.\n* * * * * *\nYesterday, the German paper Bild am Sonntag reported that after President Obama ordered the NSA to cease its eavesdropping on the communications of Chancellor Angela Merkel, they responded by increasing their surveillance of her closest ministers and advisers. Aside from providing yet another illustration of the out-of-control entitlement that drives the U.S. Surveillance State, note that the report is based on \u201ca high-ranking NSA employee in Germany\u201d, which means that this is yet another NSA source to come forward to disclose the agency\u2019s once-secret acts.",

    "content": "The federal agency that stored, and lost, millions of current and former government employees\u2019 sensitive files, fingerprints, and security clearances spent only a small fraction of what other federal agencies allocated for cybersecurity, according to a new report published by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday.\nThe Office of Personnel Management breach, announced last June, involved the personal data of over 20 million individuals and was described by a former NSA senior official as \u201ccrown-jewels material.\u201d The report was the conclusion of a year-long investigation following the breach.\nThe personnel agency spent just $2 million in 2015 to prevent malicious cyber activity, while the Department of Agriculture doled out $39 million. The departments of Commerce, Education, and Labor also spent more in this area. Among the categories of cybersecurity spending delineated by the committee \u2014 preventing malicious cyber activity, detecting, analyzing, and mitigating intrusions, and shaping the cybersecurity environment \u2014 only the Small Business Administration spent as little as OPM (although Small Business Administration spent more overall on cybersecurity).\nOPM responded by saying the report does not actively reflect the progress the agency has made since the hack, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, insisted the report was flawed, in part because it failed to place blame on or otherwise account for the contractors involved in the agency\u2019s cybersecurity. Additionally, an entirely new agency, the National Background Investigations Bureau, will now be in charge of the security clearance process.\nMore money doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better security, however. According to analysis from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University published in January 2015, the government invested more money in cybersecurity, but failed to stem the increasing flow of cyber breaches.\nYet for an agency tasked with protecting sensitive personnel data, it didn\u2019t appear to invest much in making sure adversaries couldn\u2019t access its databases. The breach, according to many national security officials, will take years to recover from.\n\u201cDespite this high value information maintained by OPM, the agency failed to prioritize cybersecurity,\u201d wrote the authors of the report, including Committee Chairman Rep.

    "title": "Paying Taxes Is a Lot Better Than Phony Corporate Courage, Apple",
    "content": "Every fall the internet and its resident tech mumblers congregate for The Apple Event, a quasi-pagan streaming-video rite in which Tim Cook boasts of just how much money his company is making (a lot) and just how much good it\u2019s introducing to the world (this typically involves a new iPhone). This is merely annoying most years; but in 2016, when Apple is loudly, publicly denying its tax obligations around the world, it\u2019s just gross.\nToday\u2019s iteration of the ritual, which spanned roughly two hours and included about five minutes of news, began with a rundown of some very large numbers: Apple\u2019s streaming music service has over 17 million paying subscribers, its App Store has topped 140 billion downloads, and that store\u2019s revenue is double that of its Google counterpart. After a brief preview of an upcoming Super Mario game for the iPhone, sure to be a revenue blockbuster, Cook segued into a spiel about the importance of education and the necessity of providing proper resources to students. His solution: a new version of iWork, Apple\u2019s productivity software suite, that allows for multiple kids to edit the same document at the same time. It seems unlikely this will make a substantial difference in the quality of education for children around the world \u2014 particularly in countries where public schools are underfunded because companies like Apple deliberately avoid paying taxes.\nApple, despite (or more likely, because of) its recurring status as the most valuable company in the history of capitalism, funnels a huge portion of its profits overseas, particularly to Ireland, in order to avoid paying its fair share at home in the United States. This year, the company has come under fire from the EU for failing to pay what it should even in the zone where it\u2019s stashing its profits \u2014 the European Commission has demanded a $15 billion payment from Apple over unpaid Irish taxes, a sum Ireland is actually refusing to accept for fear it will lose its coveted status as Apple\u2019s unscrupulously convenient money dump. Meanwhile, the United States is condemning the EU\u2019s ruling because it\u2019s also battling Apple for unpaid taxes \u2014 it has apparently not occurred to either party that Apple is so unfathomably cash-rich that it could satisfy its tax obligations on two continents at once.\nThe official corporate position is now effectively We\u2019ll pay what we want, and you\u2019ll deal with it; Tim Cook himself has said Apple will only repatriate its vast billions to the U.S. if it\u2019s at a rate he considers \u201cfair.\u201d Cook simultaneously claims Apple is already paying more in taxes than anyone else in the world, which as Bloomberg\u2019s Shira Ovide puts it, \u201chas the benefit of possibly being true and impossible to verify.\u201d\nApple\u2019s tax schemes cannot be dismissed as merely matching the competition for reasons of corporate pragmatism. Yes, Google and Facebook engage in aggressive tax avoidance too. But Cook appears to be pushing for permanently lower corporate taxes. That\u2019s the best explanation for why he has helped raise money for Republican legislators despite sharp differences on social issues (Cook is the world\u2019s most prominent gay executive). This seems like as good a point as any to mention that Cook today boasted that Apple has sold over a billion iPhones around the world \u2014 the iPhone 7 will retail for $649.\nAnd so it\u2019s hard to swallow Apple\u2019s use of the word \u201ccourage\u201d to describe the corporate ethos that pushed the company to remove the headphone plug from the newest iPhone while offering a new pair of jack-free earbuds that will run you $160. Removing a headphone jack or adding 20 headphone jacks does not require courage; engineers are very smart, but their job does not typically require much bravery. Courage is more often found in, say, running into a burning school to rescue the students and class rodent. Or, maybe, you could call courageous the act of paying the many billions you owe around the world into the system that ensures those students have all of the resources they need in order to learn and grow. Just a hint: Collaborative spreadsheet software doesn\u2019t count.",

    "title": "Google Program to Deradicalize Jihadis Will Be Used for Right-Wing American Extremists Next",
    "content": "A Google-incubated program that has been targeting potential ISIS members with deradicalizing content will soon be used to target violent right-wing extremists in North America, a designer of the program said at an event at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday.\nUsing research and targeted advertising, the initiative by London-based startup Moonshot CVE and Google\u2019s Jigsaw technology incubator targets potentially violent jihadis and directs them to a YouTube channel with videos that refute ISIS propaganda.\nIn the pilot program countering ISIS, the so-called Redirect Method collected the metadata of 320,000 individuals over the course of eight weeks, using 1,700 keywords, and served them advertisements that led them to the videos. Collectively, the targets watched more than half a million minutes of videos.\nThe event at Brookings was primarily about the existing program aimed at undermining ISIS recruiting. \u201cI think this is an extremely promising method,\u201d said Richard Stengel, U.S. undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.\nRoss Frenett, co-founder of Moonshot, said his company and Jigsaw are now working with funding from private groups, including the Gen Next Foundation, to target other violent extremists, including on the hard right.\n\u201cWe are very conscious \u2014 as our own organization and I know Jigsaw are \u2014 that this [violent extremism] is not solely the problem of one particular group,\u201d Frenett said.\n\u201cOur efforts during phase two, when we\u2019re going to focus on the violent far right in America, will be very much focused on the small element of those that are violent. The interesting thing about how they behave is they\u2019re a little bit more brazen online these days than ISIS fan boys,\u201d Frenett said.\nHe noted that this new target demographic is more visible online.\n\u201cIn the U.K., if someone in their Facebook profile picture has a swastika and is pointing a gun at the camera, that person is committing a crime,\u201d Frenett said. \u201cIn the U.S., there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. So we found that when we\u2019re looking for individuals that are genuinely at risk of carrying out violence, that they\u2019re relatively open online.\u201d\nAdnan Kifayat, head of global security ventures at Gen Next Foundation, said he is optimistic about applying the ISIS approach to North America. \u201cOur interest is in countering extremism \u2026 particularly in the homeland,\u201d he told The Intercept.\nGen Next Foundation, based in Newport Beach, California, was founded by a group of young executives, authors, entrepreneurs, and others to fight terrorism.\nIn the ISIS pilot program, the YouTube channel pulls pre-existing videos that, according to Yasmin Green, the head of research and development for Jigsaw, \u201crefute ISIS\u2019s messaging.\u201d\nOne video is from a woman who secretly filmed her life in ISIS-controlled Raqqa. Another shows young people in Mosul, their faces obscured by keffiyehs for their protection, talking about life under the Islamic State.\n\u201cThe branding philosophy for the entire pilot project was not to appear judgmental or be moralistic, but really to pique interest of individuals who have questions, questions that are being raised and answered by the Islamic State,\u201d Green said.\nThe next phase will also home in on changes in users\u2019 behavior.\n\u201cThe idea that you can\u2019t measure consumption patterns online is frankly absurd,\u201d Frenett said.",

    "title": "NBC\u2019s Military Forum Was a Master Class on How Not to Hold Candidates Accountable",
    "content": "The \u201cCommander-in-Chief Forum\u201d with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer moderated Wednesday night was billed as a way to interrogate the presidential candidates on substantive veterans\u2019 and national security issues.\nBut from the questions chosen to the format, the event served as little more than a class on how not to hold the candidates accountable.\nIn the 25 minutes devoted to Clinton, nearly half was spent by Lauer grilling her about her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state (one veteran also asked about the issue). That left little room for questions on policies she presided over while in office.\nLauer repeatedly failed to fact-check candidates on their responses to questions. When Hillary Clinton explained her anti-ISIS plan by saying \u201cwe are not going to have ground troops in Iraq,\u201d he failed to point out that we already do have those troops. When Donald Trump claimed to have opposed the wars in Iraq and Libya from the beginning, Lauer failed to correct him and tell the audience that wasn\u2019t true.\nThe forum was co-sponsored with the veterans group the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), and some of the strongest questions came from veterans themselves \u2014 such as one question about how war veterans can trust a candidate with hawkish tendencies to end U.S. wars (Clinton) and another about how we can de-escalate tensions with Russia (Trump).\nUnfortunately, those veterans received little airtime. Despite the fact that this is the only general election presidential forum so far focused exclusively on veterans\u2019 and national security issues, NBC limited it to one hour. In that hour, a total of three minutes was spent taking questions from 10 questioners (four veterans asking questions of Clinton and six for Trump). The veterans were not allowed to ask follow-up questions or to offer any audible evaluation of the answers they elicited.\nLauer chose to ask Trump about his preparedness and past remarks, rather than question his actual plans. \u201cI\u2019d like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander in chief,\u201d said Lauer. Lauer would go on to further question Trump about his \u201cpreparedness,\u201d his \u201ctemperament,\u201d and his receptiveness to intelligence briefings.\nIt was left to the veterans to ask Trump about how to defeat ISIS, how to bring stability to the Middle East, how to stop veteran suicides and sexual violence in the military, and whether undocumented immigrants can serve in the armed forces. Lauer offered no meaningful challenges to any of his answers.\nLauer could have challenged Trump on his previous proposals, like \u201cbombing the shit out of ISIS,\u201d or on how tonight\u2019s suggestions \u2014 like \u201cleave a certain group behind and take various sections where they have the oil\u201d \u2013 were supposed to bring lasting peace to the Middle East. But he did not.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, just eight hours before the forum, Trump proposed a dramatic expansion in the size of the military, increasing the army from 475,000 active duty soldiers to 540,000 \u2014 roughly the amount deployed at the height of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars \u2014 and adding roughly 100 ships and fighter jets to the Navy and Air Force. But Trump did not explain how he intended to pay for those hundred-billion-dollar proposals, or even attempt to show how they would help defeat ISIS.\nLauer failed to raise many of the most controversial national security issues in the post-9/11 world. For Lauer, the issue was whether Clinton\u2019s emails contained information on the covert drone program, not whether the covert drone program was legal or ethical. He never to pressed her about the surveillance implications of her \u201cintelligence surge,\u201d or what \u201cworking with experts in Silicon Valley\u201d meant. Trump was never asked to defend his proposals to infiltrate American mosques and spy on predominantly Muslim neighborhoods. At no point was either candidate pressed for their stance on the drone war, torture, Guant\u00e1namo Bay, or mass surveillance.\n\u201cThis forum was an absolute disgrace. Matt Lauer treated this forum less as a chance to educate voters about the real differences in temperament and policy between the candidates and more as a chance to do clickbait trolling. Instead of asking about big ideas, he asked small-bore questions that voters aren\u2019t asking at their dinner tables,\u201d Adam Green\u2019s Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is pushing for a debate format where Americans generate and rank questions to be asked of the candidates, said in response to NBC\u2019s forum.",

    "content": "As ruelas estreitas s\u00e3o calmas e tortuosas, cercadas por campos esverdeados e com raros sinais de vida, exceto os eventuais rebanhos de ovelhas. Mas, no horizonte, destacam-se estruturas que se assemelham a bolas de golfe gigantes, protegidas por uma grade perimetral coberta por arame farpado. Aqui, no cora\u00e7\u00e3o da tranquila regi\u00e3o campestre da Inglaterra, fica a maior base de espionagem no exterior da Ag\u00eancia de Seguran\u00e7a Nacional (NSA) dos EUA.\nAnteriormente conhecida apenas pelo codinome Esta\u00e7\u00e3o de campo 8613, a base secreta \u2014 agora conhecida como Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Menwith Hill \u2014 fica localizada a nove quil\u00f4metros aos leste da pequena vila de Harrogate, no norte de Yorkshire. Originalmente destinada a monitorar as comunica\u00e7\u00f5es dos sovi\u00e9ticos durante a Guerra Fria, a esta\u00e7\u00e3o teve seu foco drasticamente alterado e, hoje, \u00e9 parte fundamental da rede de vigil\u00e2ncia global em expans\u00e3o da NSA.\nPor muitos anos, jornalistas e pesquisadores especularam a respeito do que realmente se passaria dentro de Menwith Hill. Alguns pol\u00edticos e grupos defensores dos direitos humanos fazem campanha por maior transpar\u00eancia nas atividades da esta\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo, o governo brit\u00e2nico sempre foi enf\u00e1tico ao se recusar a discutir as atividades da base, alegando a velha pol\u00edtica de n\u00e3o comentar assuntos de seguran\u00e7a nacional.\nPor\u00e9m, os documentos confidenciais recentemente obtidos pelo The Intercept fornecem informa\u00e7\u00f5es exclusivas sobre o que acontece por tr\u00e1s das grades de arame farpado de Menwith Hill. Os arquivos revelam pela primeira vez como a NSA usou a base brit\u00e2nica para auxiliar \u201cum n\u00famero consider\u00e1vel de opera\u00e7\u00f5es de captura e exterm\u00ednio\u201d por todo o Oriente M\u00e9dio e pelo norte da \u00c1frica, equipada com poderosas tecnologias de grampo que podem coletar dados na ordem de mais de 300 milh\u00f5es de e-mails e chamadas telef\u00f4nicas por dia.\nNa \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, mostram os documentos, a NSA foi pioneira em programas de espionagem inovadores em Menwith Hill para identificar com precis\u00e3o a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de suspeitos de terrorismo acessando a internet nos cantos mais obscuros do planeta. Um dos programas, chamado Ghosthunter, apoiou opera\u00e7\u00f5es militares convencionais brit\u00e2nicas e americanas no Iraque e no Afeganist\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, contribuiu para miss\u00f5es secretas em pa\u00edses aos quais os EUA n\u00e3o declararam guerra, incluindo um caso onde o programa ajudou uma equipe de opera\u00e7\u00f5es especiais secretas a ca\u00e7ar um membro da Al Qaeda no L\u00edbano. Os funcion\u00e1rios da NSA de Menwith Hill tamb\u00e9m colaboraram em um projeto que visava \u201celiminar\u201d alvos terroristas no I\u00eamen, onde os EUA conduzem uma campanha de bombardeio por drone que resultou em dezenas de civis mortos.\nAs revela\u00e7\u00f5es sobre Menwith Hill levantam novas d\u00favidas a respeito da extens\u00e3o da colabora\u00e7\u00e3o brit\u00e2nica nos ataques americanos atrav\u00e9s de drones e outras miss\u00f5es conhecidas como assassinatos seletivos, que podem ter violado leis internacionais e configurado crimes de guerra em alguns casos. Sucessivos governos brit\u00e2nicos declararam publicamente que todas as atividades na base foram realizadas com o \u201cconhecimento e consentimento completo\u201d dos oficiais brit\u00e2nicos.\nAs revela\u00e7\u00f5es representam \u201cmais um exemplo do inaceit\u00e1vel n\u00edvel de sigilo em torno da participa\u00e7\u00e3o do Reino Unido no programa de \u201cassassinatos seletivos\u201d dos EUA\u201d, contou Kat Craig, diretora jur\u00eddica do grupo de direitos humanos londrino Reprieve, ao The Intercept.\n\u201cAgora, \u00e9 imperativo que o primeiro ministro seja franco a respeito do envolvimento do Reino Unido nos assassinatos seletivos\u201d, disse Craig, \u201cpara garantir que funcion\u00e1rios e recursos brit\u00e2nicos n\u00e3o sejam afetados por atividades imorais e ilegais\u201d.\nO Ministro da Defesa do governo brit\u00e2nico, que lida com a assessoria de imprensa de Menwith Hill, se recusou a responder \u00e0 reportagem.\nA NSA enviou uma solicita\u00e7\u00e3o de declara\u00e7\u00e3o para o gabinete do Diretor de Intelig\u00eancia Nacional.\nRichard Kolko, porta-voz do DNI, disse em nota: \u201cOs homens e mulheres que servem \u00e0 comunidade de intelig\u00eancia asseguram a seguran\u00e7a nacional dos EUA coletando informa\u00e7\u00f5es, conduzindo an\u00e1lises e fornecendo intelig\u00eancia para que decis\u00f5es sejam tomadas com embasamento, de acordo com um conjunto de leis, pol\u00edticas e diretrizes rigorosas\u201d.\nO equipamento em Menwith Hill encontra-se distribu\u00eddo por 2,5 km2 de terras, vigiado 24 horas por dia pela Pol\u00edcia Militar brit\u00e2nica e monitorado por c\u00e2meras de instaladas em postes que observam quase todas as se\u00e7\u00f5es da grade perimetral de 3m de altura.O detalhe que mais salta aos olhos \u00e9 o aglomerado de aproximadamente 30 domos brancos gigantes. Al\u00e9m disso, as instala\u00e7\u00f5es tamb\u00e9m abrigam uma pequena comunidade completamente independente, acess\u00edvel apenas \u00e0queles com passes de seguran\u00e7a. Dentre os edif\u00edcios de opera\u00e7\u00e3o onde os analistas escutam conversas monitoradas, h\u00e1 uma pista de boliche, uma sala de bilhar, um bar, um restaurante fastfood e uma loja de conveni\u00eancias.\nGrande parte das chamadas internacionais, do tr\u00e1fego de internet, e-mails e outras formas de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o do mundo inteiro s\u00e3o enviados atrav\u00e9s de uma rede de cabos submarinos que conectam pa\u00edses como art\u00e9rias gigantes. Em postos de espionagem por todo o mundo, a NSA e seus parceiros usam esses cabos para monitorar o fluxo de informa\u00e7\u00f5es que passam por eles. Mas a base Menwith Hill se especializou em um tipo diferente de vigil\u00e2ncia: intercepta\u00e7\u00e3o de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es transmitidas pelo ar.\nDe acordo com os documentos confidenciais cedidos ao The Intercept por Edward Snowden, Menwith Hill tem dois recursos de espionagem de destaque. O primeiro \u00e9 conhecido como Fornsat e usa uma antena poderosa, dentro de um dos domos em forma de bola de golfe, para interceptar comunica\u00e7\u00f5es enquanto est\u00e3o sendo transmitidas por sat\u00e9lites estrangeiros. O segundo se chama Overhead e usa sat\u00e9lites do governo americano que orbitam o globo e sobrevoam pa\u00edses espec\u00edficos para monitorar as comunica\u00e7\u00f5es sem fio, como chamadas de celular realizadas em ch\u00e3o firme, e para tirar fotos a\u00e9reas de \u00e1reas de interesse.\nNo final dos anos 80, as redes de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o internacionais foram revolucionadas por cabos submarinos de fibra \u00f3tica. A nova tecnologia era mais barata do que o uso de sat\u00e9lites e podia transmitir dados pelo globo muito mais rapidamente que antes, em velocidades pr\u00f3ximas \u00e0 velocidade da luz. Por esse motivo, de acordo com os documentos da NSA, na metade dos anos 90, a comunidade de intelig\u00eancia dos EUA estava convencida de que as comunica\u00e7\u00f5es via sat\u00e9lite se tornariam obsoletas em pouco tempo e que deveriam ser substitu\u00eddas por redes de cabo de fibra \u00f3tica.Mas tais previs\u00f5es estavam erradas. E milh\u00f5es de chamadas de telefone ainda s\u00e3o transmitidas via sat\u00e9lite, bem como grandes volumes de dados de internet, que a NSA tem explorado constantemente em Menwith Hill.\n\u201cO setor comercial de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es via sat\u00e9lite continua vivo e rent\u00e1vel, e transbordando de tr\u00e1fego DNI (Digital Network Intelligence \u2013 Informa\u00e7\u00f5es de redes digitais) em massa, cada vez mais sofisticado, em sua grande maioria sem criptografia\u201d, conforme descreveu um documento de 2006 da NSA. \u201cEssa \u00fanica fonte de informa\u00e7\u00f5es oferece mais dados a serem examinados pelos analistas de Menwith Hill do que encontrava-se dispon\u00edvel para toda a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito pouco tempo.\u201d\nOs governos do Reino Unido e dos EUA enganaram seus cidad\u00e3os deliberadamente por anos usando uma \u201cdesculpa\u201d.\nAt\u00e9 2009, a miss\u00e3o de vigil\u00e2ncia de sat\u00e9lites estrangeiros de Menwith Hill, Moonpenny, monitorava 163 links de dados de sat\u00e9lite. As comunica\u00e7\u00f5es interceptadas eram canalizadas para uma grande variedade de reposit\u00f3rios que armazenavam chamadas telef\u00f4nicas, mensagens de texto, e-mails, hist\u00f3ricos de busca na internet e outros dados.\nN\u00e3o se sabe exatamente o volume de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es que Menwith Hill pode acessar por vez, mas os documentos da NSA indicam que o n\u00famero \u00e9 extremamente alto. Em um \u00fanico per\u00edodo de 12 horas, em maio de 2011, por exemplo, os sistemas de vigil\u00e2ncia registraram mais de 355 milh\u00f5es de registros de metadados que revelam informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre tais comunica\u00e7\u00f5es \u2014 como remetente e destinat\u00e1rio de um e-mail ou n\u00fameros de telefone discados e hor\u00e1rio da chamada realizada por algu\u00e9m.\nCom o objetivo de manter sob sigilo as informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o papel de vigil\u00e2ncia de Menwith Hill, os governos do Reino Unido e dos EUA enganaram seus cidad\u00e3os por anos usando uma \u201cdesculpa\u201d, retratando a base como uma instala\u00e7\u00e3o destinada a fornecer \u201crel\u00e9s de r\u00e1dio r\u00e1pidos e conduzir pesquisas na \u00e1rea de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d. Um documento confidencial do governo americano, datado de 2005, alertou funcion\u00e1rios de ag\u00eancias espi\u00e3s a respeito de deixarem escapar a verdade sobre a base. \u201c\u00c9 importante conhecer a desculpa adotada para a exist\u00eancia da MHS [Menwith Hill Station (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o)] e esconder o fato de que a MHS \u00e9 uma instala\u00e7\u00e3o de coleta de intelig\u00eancia\u201d, informava o documento. \u201cQualquer refer\u00eancia a sat\u00e9lites sendo operados ou relacionados a coleta de intelig\u00eancia \u00e9 estritamente proibida\u201d.\nO posto militar foi constru\u00eddo nos anos 50, como parte de um acordo entre os governos brit\u00e2nico e americano, com o intuito de abrigar funcion\u00e1rios americanos e equipamentos de vigil\u00e2ncia para interceptar chamadas telef\u00f4nicas. Em seus primeiros anos, a tecnologia existente em Menwith Hill era muito mais primitiva. De acordo com Kenneth Bird, que trabalhou na base nos 60, durante a Guerra Fria, a base se concentrava em monitorar as comunica\u00e7\u00f5es da Europa Ocidental. As conversas interceptadas eram gravadas em fitas Ampex, de acordo com o testemunho de Bird publicado em 1997, com algumas chamadas transcritas em tempo real por analistas em m\u00e1quinas de escrever.\nA base de Menwith Hill \u00e9 um lugar muito diferente nos dias de hoje. Seus sistemas de espionagem s\u00e3o capazes de ingerir muito mais dados de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, bem como tem um alcance geogr\u00e1fico muito mais amplo. Al\u00e9m disso, os objetos de vigil\u00e2ncia mudaram drasticamente, assim como a finalidade dos grampos realizados.\nOs documentos obtidos por The Intercept revelam que os sat\u00e9lites de espionagem usados em Menwith Hill atualmente podem interceptar comunica\u00e7\u00f5es na China e na Am\u00e9rica Latina, al\u00e9m de possibilitar uma \u201ccobertura cont\u00ednua da maioria do territ\u00f3rio da Eur\u00e1sia\u201d, onde interceptam \u201csinais estrat\u00e9gicos de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o militar, cient\u00edfica, pol\u00edtica, t\u00e9cnica e econ\u00f4mica\u201d. Mas talvez a fun\u00e7\u00e3o mais importante desempenhada pela base nos \u00faltimos anos tenha sido no Oriente M\u00e9dio e no Norte da \u00c1frica.\nEspecialmente em partes remotas do planeta, onde n\u00e3o h\u00e1 links de cabos de fibra \u00f3tica, \u00e9 comum que as conex\u00f5es de internet e chamadas de telefone se deem via sat\u00e9lite. Por consequ\u00eancia, Menwith Hill se tornou uma base vital para a campanha antiterrorismo do governo dos EUA depois dos ataques de 11 de setembro. Desde ent\u00e3o, a base tem sido usada de forma intensa para interceptar as comunica\u00e7\u00f5es de \u00e1reas menos acess\u00edveis, onde sabe-se que grupos extremistas isl\u00e2micos, como al Qaeda e al Shabaab, operam \u2014 por exemplo, na regi\u00e3o da fronteira entre Afeganist\u00e3o e Paquist\u00e3o, na Som\u00e1lia e no I\u00eamen.\nMais importante ainda \u00e9 o fato de Menwith Hill ter sido usada para outras atividades, que n\u00e3o a coleta de intelig\u00eancia de pessoas e governos de pa\u00edses do Oriente M\u00e9dio e do Norte da \u00c1frica. Tais ferramentas de vigil\u00e2ncia, como o sistema Ghosthunter, foram desenvolvidas com o objetivo \u00fanico de auxiliar opera\u00e7\u00f5es militares, precisando as localiza\u00e7\u00f5es de pessoas ou grupos espec\u00edficos para que fossem capturados ou assassinados.Os documentos revelados descrevem o Ghosthunter como meio de \u201clocalizar alvos quando entram na internet\u201d. O sistema foi desenvolvido em 2006 como o \u201c\u00fanico recurso de seu tipo\u201d e permitiu \u201cum n\u00famero representativo de opera\u00e7\u00f5es de captura e exterm\u00ednio\u201d contra supostos terroristas. Apenas alguns exemplos espec\u00edficos s\u00e3o oferecidos, mas esses casos d\u00e3o exemplos not\u00e1veis do poder extraordin\u00e1rio da tecnologia.\nEm um caso ocorrido em 2007, analistas de Menwith Hill usaram o Ghosthunter para localizar um \u201cintermedi\u00e1rio\u201d no L\u00edbano que era descrito como \u201caltamente ativo\u201d \u2013 ou seja, considerado um alvo leg\u00edtimo para assassinato ou captura. A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do alvo \u2014 que era conhecido por diversos nomes, inclusive Abu Sumayah \u2014 foi realizada com uma margem de erro de poucas centenas de metros, de acordo com as intercepta\u00e7\u00f5es de suas comunica\u00e7\u00f5es. Em seguida, um sat\u00e9lite espacial tirou fotografias a\u00e9reas do bairro de Sidon, no sul do L\u00edbano, onde acreditava-se que o indiv\u00edduo residia, mapeando as ruas e casas no entorno. Um documento altamente secreto com mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a vigil\u00e2ncia indica que a informa\u00e7\u00e3o foi passada para uma unidade secreta de opera\u00e7\u00f5es especiais, conhecida como Task Force 11-9, preparada para conduzir uma opera\u00e7\u00e3o secreta para assassinar ou capturar Sumayah. No entanto, o resultado da opera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 incerto, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o foi revelado no documento.\nEm outro caso, em 2007, o Ghosthunter foi usado para identificar um suposto \u201ccomprador de armas\u201d da al Qaeda no Iraque, chamado Abu Sayf. Os sistemas de vigil\u00e2ncia da NSA localizaram Sayf quando entrava em contas de e-mail e bate-papo do Yahoo em um caf\u00e9 pr\u00f3ximo a uma mesquita em Anah, uma cidade \u00e0 beira do Rio Euphrates, que fica 320 quil\u00f4metros ao noroeste de Bagd\u00e1. Os analistas em Menwith Hill usaram o Ghosthunter para precisar sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e sat\u00e9lites de espionagem operados na base brit\u00e2nica para capturar imagens a\u00e9reas. Essas informa\u00e7\u00f5es foram repassadas \u00e0s tropas americanas em Fallujah para serem inclu\u00eddas em um \u201cplano de ataque\u201d.\nAlguns dias depois, uma unidade de opera\u00e7\u00f5es especiais, a Task Force-16, invadiu duas propriedades, onde detiveram Sayf, seu pai, dois irm\u00e3os e cinco companheiros.\nEm 2008, a popularidade aparente do Ghosthunter na comunidade de intelig\u00eancia resultou em sua implementa\u00e7\u00e3o em outras bases de vigil\u00e2ncia com presen\u00e7a da NSA, incluindo Ayios Nikolaos, no Chipre, e Misawa, no Jap\u00e3o. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da ferramenta para outras bases representou um alcance \u201cpraticamente global\u201d. Mas Menwith Hill permaneceu sendo sua base mais representativa. \u201c[Menwith Hill] ainda fornece aproximadamente 99% dos dados Fornsat usados em localiza\u00e7\u00f5es geogr\u00e1ficas do Ghosthunter\u201d, confirmou um documento de janeiro de 2008 sobre o programa.\nUm documento de 2009 acrescentou que o objetivo principal do Ghosthunter, \u00e0 \u00e9poca, envolvia \u201ca localiza\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica de cibercaf\u00e9s na regi\u00e3o do Oriente M\u00e9dio/\u00c1frica do Norte em apoio \u00e0s opera\u00e7\u00f5es militares dos EUA\u201d e dizia que tinha, at\u00e9 o momento, \u201clocalizado geograficamente mais de 5 mil terminais VSAT no Iraque, Afeganist\u00e3o, S\u00edria, L\u00edbano e Ir\u00e3. VSAT, Very Small Aperture Terminal (Terminal de Abertura Muito Pequena), \u00e9 um sistema de sat\u00e9lites usado comumente por cibercaf\u00e9s e governos estrangeiros para enviar e receber comunica\u00e7\u00f5es e dados. O Ghosthunter tamb\u00e9m podia atacar VSATs no Paquist\u00e3o, Som\u00e1lia, Arg\u00e9lia, Filipinas, Mali, Qu\u00eania e Sud\u00e3o de acordo com os documentos.\nA capacidade exclusiva a Menwith Hill de rastrear sat\u00e9lites em qualquer lugar do planeta, por vezes, colocou-o na linha de frente de conflito a milhares de quil\u00f4metros de dist\u00e2ncia. No Afeganist\u00e3o, por exemplo, analistas da base usaram a vigil\u00e2ncia VSAT para rastrear membros suspeitos do Talib\u00e3, resultando em \u201caproximadamente 30 inimigos assassinados\u201d durante uma s\u00e9rie de ataques mencionados em um relat\u00f3rio top-secret de julho de 2011. No come\u00e7o de 2012, analistas da base foram solicitados a rastrear um VSAT: desta vez, para auxiliar as for\u00e7as especiais na prov\u00edncia de Helmand, no Afeganist\u00e3o. A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do terminal foi r\u00e1pida e, em menos de uma hora, um drone MQ-9 Reaper foi enviado para a \u00e1rea para iniciar um ataque a\u00e9reo, ao que tudo indica.\nMas o uso letal de dados de vigil\u00e2ncia n\u00e3o parece ter sido restrito a \u00e1reas de guerra convencionais, como o Afeganist\u00e3o ou o Iraque. A NSA desenvolveu m\u00e9todos semelhantes em Menwith Hill para rastrear suspeitos de terrorismo no I\u00eamen, onde os EUA haviam iniciado ataques secretos com drones contra militantes associados a al Qaeda na pen\u00ednsula norte.\nNo come\u00e7o de 2010, a ag\u00eancia revelou em um relat\u00f3rio interno que tinha inaugurado uma t\u00e9cnica nova na base brit\u00e2nica para identificar diversos alvos \u201cem quase 40 cibercaf\u00e9s localizados em pontos geogr\u00e1ficos distintos\u201d na prov\u00edncia de Shabwah, no I\u00eamen, e na capital do pa\u00eds. A t\u00e9cnica, de acordo com o documento, era vinculada a uma iniciativa secreta mais ampla, chamada Ghostwolf, descrita como um projeto para \u201ccapturar ou eliminar n\u00f3s cruciais em redes terroristas\u201d, concentrando-se primordialmente em \u201cfornecer dados de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica obtidos atrav\u00e9s de [vigil\u00e2ncia] de clientes e de seus componentes operacionais\u201d.\nA descri\u00e7\u00e3o do Ghostwolf vincula Menwith Hill a opera\u00e7\u00f5es letais no I\u00eamen, fornecendo as primeiras provas documentais que implicam o Reino Unido diretamente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s opera\u00e7\u00f5es secretas no pa\u00eds.\nA dimens\u00e3o da evidente cumplicidade do governo brit\u00e2nico em controversos ataques dos EUA foi real\u00e7ada pelo papel anteriormente desconhecido da base militar de Menwith Hill no assassinato seletivo de suspeitos de terrorismo, suscitando d\u00favidas sobre a legalidade das opera\u00e7\u00f5es secretas realizadas a partir da base.\nH\u00e1 cerca de 1.800 funcion\u00e1rios em Menwith Hill, a maioria americanos. Al\u00e9m dos funcion\u00e1rios da NSA no complexo, o National Reconnaissance Office (NRO \u2013 Departamento de Reconhecimento Nacional) tamb\u00e9m tem uma presen\u00e7a importante no local, operando sua pr\u00f3pria \u201cesta\u00e7\u00e3o terrestre\u201d, a partir da qual controla diversos sat\u00e9lites de espionagem.\nNo entanto, foi apenas em 2014 que o governo brit\u00e2nico assumiu publicamente que as opera\u00e7\u00f5es na base \u201csempre foram, e continuam sendo\u201d executadas com seu \u201cconhecimento e consentimento\u201d. Al\u00e9m disso, aproximadamente 500 dos funcion\u00e1rios nas instala\u00e7\u00f5es pertencem a ag\u00eancias do Reino Unido, incluindo funcion\u00e1rios do organismo brit\u00e2nico hom\u00f3logo da NSA, o Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ \u2013 Quartel-general de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o do Governo brit\u00e2nico).\nH\u00e1 v\u00e1rios anos que ativistas e legisladores na \u00e1rea dos direitos humanos pressionam o governo no sentido de fornecer informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre seu envolvimento nas opera\u00e7\u00f5es americanas de assassinato seletivo, contudo, a \u00fanica resposta at\u00e9 agora foi o sil\u00eancio. Mais especificamente, houve uma tentativa de determinar se o Reino Unido teria ajudado nos bombardeios com drones dos EUA fora de zonas de guerra declaradas, incluindo em pa\u00edses como I\u00eamen, Paquist\u00e3o e Som\u00e1lia, que resultaram na morte de centenas de civis e foram, em alguns casos, considerados por funcion\u00e1rios das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas como poss\u00edveis crimes de guerra e viola\u00e7\u00f5es da lei internacional.\nApesar de indicarem que Menwith Hill ajudou \u201cem um n\u00famero consider\u00e1vel\u201d de opera\u00e7\u00f5es de \u201ccaptura e assassinato\u201d, os documentos de Snowden analisados pelo The Intercept n\u00e3o revelam detalhes espec\u00edficos sobre todos os incidentes que resultaram em v\u00edtimas mortais. No entanto, ficou claro que a base teve como alvos pa\u00edses como o I\u00eamen, Paquist\u00e3o e Som\u00e1lia, inclu\u00eddos em programas de rastreamento de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o como o Ghosthunter e Ghostwolf, criados para ajudar a identificar indiv\u00edduos a serem capturados ou assassinados, sugerindo uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o nos ataques com drones nesses pa\u00edses.\n\u201cUm indiv\u00edduo envolvido com a passagem dessas informa\u00e7\u00f5es pode ser considerado c\u00famplice de um homic\u00eddio.\u201d\nCraig, diretora jur\u00eddica da Reprieve, analisou os documentos de Menwith Hill, concluindo que indicavam a cumplicidade brit\u00e2nica nos ataques com drones secretos dos EUA. \u201cH\u00e1 anos que a Reprieve e outras entidades procuram obter explica\u00e7\u00f5es do governo brit\u00e2nico sobre o papel das bases brit\u00e2nicas no programa secreto de drones dos EUA, respons\u00e1vel pela morte de elevados n\u00fameros de civis em pa\u00edses com os quais n\u00e3o estamos em guerra\u201d, ela contou ao The Intercept. \u201cNos enganaram com tru\u00edsmos e nos asseguraram que todas as atividades dos EUA em bases brit\u00e2nicas, ou com o envolvimento das mesmas, estavam em total conformidade com as disposi\u00e7\u00f5es jur\u00eddicas nacionais e internacionais. Agora, parece que nada disso era verdade\u201d.\nJemima Stratford, advogada brit\u00e2nica de direitos humanos, disse ao The Intercept que existem \u201cperguntas s\u00e9rias a serem feitas e argumentos s\u00e9rios a estabelecer\u201d sobre a legalidade das opera\u00e7\u00f5es letais conduzidas com a assist\u00eancia de Menwith Hill. As opera\u00e7\u00f5es, afirmou Stratford, podem ter violado a Conven\u00e7\u00e3o Europeia dos Direitos Humanos, um tratado internacional ao qual o Reino Unido continua vinculado, apesar do voto recente pela sa\u00edda da Uni\u00e3o Europeia. O Artigo 2 da Conven\u00e7\u00e3o protege o \u201cdireito \u00e0 vida\u201d e declara que \u201cningu\u00e9m pode ser privado da vida intencionalmente\u201d, exceto se tal for ordenado por um tribunal, como pena a ser aplicada por um crime.\nStratford havia alertado anteriormente que funcion\u00e1rios brit\u00e2nicos podem ser implicados em homic\u00eddio caso tenham facilitado ataques com drones dos EUA fora de zonas de guerra declaradas. Em 2014, ela aconselhou os membros do parlamento brit\u00e2nico para o fato dos EUA n\u00e3o estarem em guerra com pa\u00edses como o I\u00eamen ou Paquist\u00e3o e, portanto, no \u00e2mbito da lei inglesa e internacional, os indiv\u00edduos assassinados por drones nesses pa\u00edses n\u00e3o constitu\u00edam \u201ccombatentes\u201d, nem seus assassinos eram beneficiados pela \u201cimunidade de combatente\u201d.\n\u201cSe o governo brit\u00e2nico tiver conhecimento da transfer\u00eancia de dados que podem ser usados em ataques por drones contra n\u00e3o combatentes (\u2026) essa transfer\u00eancia provavelmente \u00e9 ilegal\u201d, disse Stratford aos membros do parlamento. \u201cUm indiv\u00edduo envolvido na transmiss\u00e3o dessas informa\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9, provavelmente, c\u00famplice de homic\u00eddio.\u201d\nO GCHQ se recusou a responder perguntas da reportagem, citando uma \u201cvelha pol\u00edtica da ag\u00eancia que define que n\u00e3o comentamos a respeito de quest\u00f5es de intelig\u00eancia\u201d. Um porta-voz da ag\u00eancia publicou uma nota gen\u00e9rica declarando que \u201ctodo o trabalho do GCHQ \u00e9 realizado de acordo com fundamentos jur\u00eddicos e de pol\u00edtica rigorosos, que garantem que nossas atividades s\u00e3o autorizadas, necess\u00e1rias e proporcionais, e que seguem uma supervis\u00e3o rigorosa\u201d. O porta-voz insistiu que o \u201cregime de intercepta\u00e7\u00e3o do Reino Unido \u00e9 inteiramente compat\u00edvel com a Conven\u00e7\u00e3o Europeia de Direitos Humanos\u201d.\nEm fevereiro de 2014, o departamento de Defesa dos EUA, depois de uma revis\u00e3o de procedimento, anunciou que planejava reduzir o n\u00famero de funcion\u00e1rios em Menwith Hill em 2016, com cortes estimados em 500 militares e civis. Um porta-voz da For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea dos EUA contou ao jornal militar Stars and Strips que a decis\u00e3o foi baseada em avan\u00e7os tecnol\u00f3gicos, dos quais se recusou falar, apesar de mencionar expans\u00e3o na \u201ccapacidade dos servidores que estamos usando; estamos fazendo mais com menos hardware\u201d.\nOs documentos fornecidos por Snowden esclarecem algumas das altera\u00e7\u00f5es tecnol\u00f3gicas espec\u00edficas. Mais especificamente, mostram que houve um investimento consider\u00e1vel em introduzir sistemas de vigil\u00e2ncia em massa mais sofisticados em Menwith Hill nos \u00faltimos anos. Em 2008, o ent\u00e3o Diretor da NSA, Keith Alexander, introduziu uma mudan\u00e7a de dire\u00e7\u00e3o nas pol\u00edticas da ag\u00eancia. Em uma visita a Menwith Hill em junho daquele ano, Alexander desafiou os funcion\u00e1rios da base. \u201cPor que n\u00e3o podemos coletar todos os sinais, o tempo inteiro?\u201d disse o diretor, de acordo com os documentos da NSA. \u201cSoa como um belo trabalho de casa para Menwith\u201d.\nEm decorr\u00eancia disso, uma nova \u201cpostura de coleta\u201d foi introduzida na base com o objetivo de \u201ccoletar tudo, processar tudo e explorar tudo\u201d. Em outras palavras, a base deveria ingerir o m\u00e1ximo de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es que sua capacidade tecnol\u00f3gica permitisse.\nEntre 2009 e 2012, mais de US$ 40 milh\u00f5es foram gastos em Menwith Hill para construir um novo pr\u00e9dio de opera\u00e7\u00f5es com 9.000 m2 \u2014 uma \u00e1rea equivalente a dois campos de futebol americano. Grande parte desse espa\u00e7o \u2014 aproximadamente 1.000 m2 \u2014 foram reservados para um centro de dados que contava com a capacidade de armazenar quantidades enormes de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es interceptadas. Durante a reforma, a NSA enviou nossos sistemas de computadores e instalou 300 km de cabos, extens\u00e3o suficiente para conectar Nova York a Boston. A ag\u00eancia tamb\u00e9m construiu um audit\u00f3rio com capacidade para 200 pessoas destinado a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de reuni\u00f5es sobre opera\u00e7\u00f5es secretas e outros eventos.\n\u201cComo podemos autorizar opera\u00e7\u00f5es em Menwith sobre as quais n\u00e3o podemos prestar contas ao p\u00fablico?\u201d\nParte do enorme trabalho de expans\u00e3o podia ser notado da rua no entorno do complexo de seguran\u00e7a, resultando em protestos de um grupo de ativistas locais chamado Campanha de Responsabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das Bases Americanas. Desde o come\u00e7o dos anos 90, o grupo monitora de perto as atividades em Menwith Hill. H\u00e1 12 anos, seus membros realizam um pequeno protesto toda ter\u00e7a-feira na entrada principal da base militar, saudando funcion\u00e1rios da NSA com bandeiras e banners com inscri\u00e7\u00f5es cr\u00edticas \u00e0 pol\u00edtica internacional e os ataques por drones realizados pelos EUA.\nFabian Hamilton, representante da cidade de Leeds no parlamento brit\u00e2nico, se tornou um apoiador da campanha, ocasionalmente participando de eventos organizados pelo grupo e defendendo mais transpar\u00eancia em Menwith Hill. Hamilton, que representa o Partido Trabalhista, tem sido insistente em obter mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es e, desde 2010, dirigiu mais de 40 perguntas formais ao governo no parlamento brit\u00e2nico sobre as atividades realizadas na base. O parlamentar buscou esclarecimento em diversas quest\u00f5es, como por exemplo, quantos funcion\u00e1rios encontram-se registrados nas instala\u00e7\u00f5es, se a base est\u00e1 envolvida na condu\u00e7\u00e3o de ataques por drones e se os membros do comit\u00ea parlamentar de supervis\u00e3o recebeu acesso completo \u00e0 base para analisar suas opera\u00e7\u00f5es. Mas seus esfor\u00e7os foram continuamente frustrados por agentes brit\u00e2nicos que se recusam a oferecer mais detalhes alegando motivos de seguran\u00e7a nacional.\nHamilton disse ao The Intercept que considerava \u201cofensivo\u201d o sigilo em torno de Menwith Hill. As revela\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o papel desempenhado pela base nas opera\u00e7\u00f5es de assassinato e captura dos EUA, contou, provou que uma reavalia\u00e7\u00e3o completa de suas opera\u00e7\u00f5es se faz necess\u00e1ria. \u201cQualquer na\u00e7\u00e3o que usa suas for\u00e7as militares para atacar um inimigo, seja um terrorista ou n\u00e3o, seja leg\u00edtima ou n\u00e3o, tem de prestar contas a seus eleitores\u201d, contou Hamilton. \u201cEsse \u00e9 um princ\u00edpio fundamental de nosso parlamento, \u00e9 a base de todo nosso sistema democr\u00e1tico. Como podemos autorizar opera\u00e7\u00f5es em Menwith sobre as quais n\u00e3o podemos prestar contas ao p\u00fablico? Eu n\u00e3o compro essa ideia de que voc\u00ea diz a palavra \u201cseguran\u00e7a\u201d e ningu\u00e9m pode saber de nada.

    "content": "The United States is spending more money on more missions to send more elite U.S. forces to train alongside more foreign counterparts in more countries around the world, according to documents obtained by The Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act.\nUnder the Joint Combined Exchange Training program, which is designed to train America\u2019s special operators in a variety of missions \u2014 from \u201cforeign internal defense\u201d to \u201cunconventional warfare\u201d \u2014 U.S. troops carried out approximately one mission every two days in 2014, the latest year covered by the recently released documents.\nAt a price tag of more than $56 million, the U.S. sent its most elite operators \u2014 Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets, and others \u2014 on 176 individual JCETs, a 13 percent increase from 2013. The number of countries involved jumped even further, from 63 to 87, a 38 percent spike.\nThe JCET program is a key facet of a global strategy involving America\u2019s most secretive and least scrutinized troops. Since 9/11, special operations forces (SOF) have expanded in almost every conceivable way \u2014 from budget to personnel to overseas missions. On any given day, 10,000 special operators are deployed or \u201cforward stationed,\u201d conducting missions that vary \u201cfrom behind-the-scenes information-gathering and partner-building to high-end dynamic strike operations,\u201d then-chief of U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year.\nIn 2014, more than 4,800 elite troops took part in JCETs, compared to just over 3,800 the year before. \u201cThe purpose of JCETs is to foster the training of U.S. SOF in mission-critical skills by training with partner-nation forces in their home countries,\u201d Ken McGraw, a spokesperson for U.S. Special Operations Command, told The Intercept. \u201cJCETs allow U.S. SOF to use and further develop their language skills and cultural knowledge plus hone their skills training indigenous forces.\u201d\nGen. Raymond A. Thomas III, who is Votel\u2019s successor as head of SOCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that \u201cworking with our international partners allows us to share the burden more appropriately. We must engage, not only where problems occur, but also in places critical to our vital national interests where no visible threat currently exists.\u201d\nThe recently released documents note that, in addition to the training opportunities afforded to elite U.S. troops, the JCET program also provides \u201cincidental benefits,\u201d namely building military-to-military contacts, improving interoperability with foreign forces, and \u201cgaining regional access with a minimal footprint.\u201d The files further refer to JCETs as \u201clow signature\u201d missions.\nA 2015 investigation by The Intercept revealed JCETs were regularly conducted with foreign militaries implicated by the U.S. State Department in gross human rights violations. And a more recent effort by The Intercept and 100Reporters found JCETs formed one facet of a global training network typified by a lack of coherent strategy and effective oversight.\nA 2013 Rand Corp. study of JCETs conducted in areas covered by Africa Command, Pacific Command, and Southern Command found \u201cmoderately low\u201d effectiveness of the missions in all three regions. Asked for comment on the findings, McGraw of SOCOM had little to say. \u201cI have not and do not have the time to review the Rand study,\u201d he told The Intercept, noting that he was aware of no one at the command who had read Rand\u2019s analysis. \u201cWe are not going to comment on the study.\u201d",

    "title": "Obama Promises Lame-Duck TPP Push Despite Uproar Over Pro-Corporate Provisions",
    "content": "A provision that would let foreign corporations challenge new American laws and regulations has become the latest flashpoint in the battle over the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, even as President Obama on Tuesday said he will renew his push for its passage in the lame-duck session of Congress.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a political season now and it\u2019s always difficult to get things done,\u201d Obama said at a town hall meeting in Laos. \u201cSo after the election, I think people can refocus attention on why this is so important.\u201d He sounded confident: \u201cI believe that we\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\nThe latest salvo from opponents of the deal came in the form of a letter to Congress signed by hundreds of law professors and economists \u2013 including Laurence Tribe, who taught Obama at Harvard \u2013 protesting the inclusion of \u201cInvestor State Dispute Settlement\u201d (ISDS) provisions in the TPP agreement.\nThe ISDS provisions would empower corporations who object to U.S. laws and regulations that cut into their profits to sue the United States before an international arbitration panel. The signatories to the letter write that this \u201csystem undermines the important roles of our domestic and democratic institutions, threatens domestic sovereignty, and weakens the rule of law.\u201d\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a leading critic of the ISDS provisions, introduced the letter on a conference call hosted Wednesday by the advocacy group Public Citizen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about leverage,\u201d Warren said. \u201cLeverage for big companies to threaten an intimidate governments who might dare take action that threatens their profits.\u201d\nShe cited the example of Canada being successfully sued under ISDS rules contained in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by a U.S.-based company that was denied a permit for an open-pit mining project.\nListen to the call:\nThe Obama administration has pushed back at critics of the ISDS provisions, saying that it is a routine system that exists in thousands of other international agreements, including 50 that the United States is currently a party to.\nBut that routine system has undermined domestic laws in some countries.\nBuzzfeed\u2019s Chris Hamby recently reviewed dozens of ISDS rulings, documenting how corporations used these international arbitration panels to avoid the reach of domestic courts.\nFor instance, following the ouster of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, the country sentenced Dubai-based real estate mogul Hussain Sajwani to five years in prison for corruption charges related to a sweetheart land deal between his company Damac Properties and the country\u2019s Mubarak-era tourism minister.\nWithin a week of his conviction, Damac decided to sue Egypt using the World Bank\u2019s arbitration process \u2013 arguing that because the previous regime had agreed to the terms, the deal was not criminal.\nAs Sajwani enlisted the help of some of the world\u2019s top ISDS lawyers to argue his case in a court in Paris, Egypt decided to settle. The terms of the settlement are confidential, but we do know that Sajwani\u2019s prison sentence was completely eliminated.\nThat set a precedent for a wave of ISDS claims. More and more firms used the ISDS process to avoid penalties handed down from Egypt\u2019s courts.\nUnder the TPP, the U.S. would be exposed to a larger number of potential ISDS claims.\n\u201cIf these provisions are included in TPP, the number of foreign investors who\u2019d be empowered to use this mechanism would double from what we currently have in our 50 agreements already,\u201d said Melinda St. Louis, international campaigns director at Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch.\nIn all, Public Citizen estimates that passage of the TPP would newly empower over 10,000 U.S. subsidiaries owned by foreign corporations to launch investor-state cases against the American government.\nCorporations from six countries that do not currently have the ability to bring ISDS claims against the United States \u2014 Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei \u2013 would gain that right under the TPP.\nAs The Intercept has previously reported, banks and other financial institutions would be able to use TPP provisions to sue over virtually any change in financial regulations affecting future profits in an extra-judicial tribunal.\nThe United States has not yet lost an ISDS case, but is facing a major claim from TransCanada. The company is using arbitration under NAFTA to seek $15 billion after the Obama Administration decided not to approve its Keystone XL Pipeline project.",

In retrospect, analysts have pointed to the continuity in national security and intelligence advisers as an early sign that despite his campaign rhetoric Obama would end up building on \u2014 rather than tearing down \u2014 the often-extralegal, Bush-Cheney counterterror regime. For instance, while Obama promised in 2008 to reform the NSA, its director was kept on and its reach continued to grow.\nObama\u2019s most fateful decision may have been choosing former National Counterterrorism Center Director John Brennan to be national security adviser, despite Brennan\u2019s support of Bush\u2019s torture program. Brennan would go on to run the president\u2019s drone program, lead the CIA, fight the Senate\u2019s torture investigation, and then lie about searching Senate computers.\nThat backdrop is what makes Clinton\u2019s new list of advisers so significant.\nIt includes Gen. David Petraeus, the major architect of the 2007 Iraq War troop surge, which brought 30,000 more troops to Iraq. Picking him indicates at partiality to combative ideology.

For example, in 2010, he gave dozens of media interviews touting full-body scanners at airports while his firm was employed by a company that produced body scanning machines. His firm also employs a number of other ex-security state officials, such as former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden. It does not disclose a complete list of its clients \u2014 all of whom now have a line of access to Clinton.\nMany others on the list are open advocates of military escalation overseas.

Three days later, Morell told Charlie Rose in a PBS interview that the CIA should actively assassinate Russians and Iranians in Syria.\nDuring his time at the CIA, Morell was connected to some of the worst scandals and intelligence failures of the Bush administration. In his book, he apologizes for giving flawed intelligence to Colin Powell about Iraq\u2019s supposed weapons of mass destruction, but defends the CIA torture program as legal and ethical.\nJim Stavridis, a former NATO supreme allied commander Europe on Clinton\u2019s advisory group, told Fox News Radio in July, when he was being vetted by Clinton as a possible vice presidential nominee, that \u201cwe have got to get more aggressive going into Syria and Iraq and go after [ISIS] because if we don\u2019t they\u2019re going to come to us. It\u2019s a pretty simple equation.\u201d He said he would \u201cencourage the president to take a more aggressive stance against Iran, to increase our military forces in Iraq and Syria, and to confront Vladmir Putin\u201d over his moves in Crimea.\nThe New York Times reported in 2011 that Michael Vickers, a former Pentagon official on Clinton\u2019s new list, led the use of drone strikes. He would grin and tell his colleagues at meetings, \u201cI just want to kill those guys.\u201d\nOthers on the list played a role in the targeted killing policies of the Obama administration, including Chris Fussell, a top aide to Gen. Stanley McChrystal, and now a partner with him at his lucrative consulting firm, the McChrystal Group.\nFussell was aide-de-camp to McChrystal while he was serving as commander of Joint Special Operations Command. McChrystal oversaw a dramatic expansion in the use of night raids and assassinations, and would later be accused of condoning torture at JSOC\u2019s Iraq Base, Camp NAMA (code for Nasty-Ass Military Area).\nRichard Fontaine, a former McCain adviser and president of the counterinsurgency-focused think tank Center for a New American Security, responded to the Paris attacks by writing an op-ed that advocated, among other things, a U.S.-backed \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria. He has also proposed intensifying the bombing campaign against ISIS, and increasing the presence of U.S. special forces in Iraq.\nJanet Napolitano, a former Obama DHS secretary, presided over a harsh immigration policy, where the department deported a record number of undocumented immigrants \u2014 although she did support Obama\u2019s recent executive actions designed to protect some migrants.\nThe closest thing the list has to a dissenter to the status quo would appear to be Kathleen Hicks, a think tanker who served in the Obama Defense Department.

    "title": "Wolf Blitzer Is Worried Defense Contractors Will Lose Jobs if U.S. Stops Arming Saudi Arabia",
    "content": "Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s expression of opposition to a $1.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia \u2014 which has been brutally bombing civilian targets in Yemen using U.S.-made weapons for more than a year now \u2014 alarmed CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday afternoon.\nBlitzer\u2019s concern: That stopping the sale could result in fewer jobs for arms manufacturers.\n\u201cSo for you this is a moral issue,\u201d he told Paul during the Kentucky Republican\u2019s appearance on CNN. \u201cBecause you know, there\u2019s a lot of jobs at stake. Certainly if a lot of these defense contractors stop selling war planes, other sophisticated equipment to Saudi Arabia, there\u2019s going to be a significant loss of jobs, of revenue here in the United States. That\u2019s secondary from your standpoint?\u201d\nPaul stayed on message. \u201cWell not only is it a moral question, its a constitutional question,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOur founding fathers very directly and specifically did not give the president the power to go to war. They gave it to Congress. So Congress needs to step up and this is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nWatch the exchange:\nSaudi Arabia began bombing Yemen in March 2015, and has since been responsible for the majority of the 10,000 deaths in the war so far. The U.S.-backed bombing coalition has been accused of intentionally targeting civilians, hospitals, factories, markets, schools, and homes. The situation is so bad that the Red Cross has started donating morgue units to Yemeni hospitals.\nThe war\u2019s incredible humanitarian toll has generated an increasing outcry in the United States. Earlier this month, more than 60 members of Congress signed a letter asking the administration to delay the most recent arms shipment. Ordinarily, under the Arms Export Control Act, Congress has 30 days to block arms sales proposed by the administration \u2014 but by announcing the arms sale in August, most of those 30 days fell during Congress\u2019s August recess. That 30-day window expired Thursday night and the White House has not granted the request for extra time.\nThe Obama administration has sold more weapons to the Saudis than any other administration, pledging more than $115 billion worth of small arms, tanks, helicopters, missiles, and aircraft.\nSo yes, it\u2019s a legitimate moral issue. What it\u2019s not is a legitimate economic issue.\nIf you\u2019re worried about jobs, military spending is not where you look. It\u2019s an inefficient way to create jobs, because it has a lower multiplier effect \u2014 meaning how much it ripples in the wider economy. One study from 2011 found that $1 billion put into military spending would create approximately 11,200 jobs, but that same amount of money put into education creates 26,700 jobs.",

    "title": "What's Behind Barack Obama's Ongoing Accommodation of Vladimir Putin?",
    "content": "When a major party cynically espouses a set of beliefs as a tactic for winning an election, those beliefs get entrenched in popular discourse and often endure well past the election, with very significant consequences. The most significant such rhetorical template in the 2016 election \u2014 other than the new Democratic claim that big-money donations do not corrupt the political process \u2014 is that Russia is a Grave Enemy of the U.S.; anyone who advocates better relations or less tension with Moscow is a likely sympathizer, stooge, or even agent of Putin; and any associations with the Kremlin render one\u2019s loyalties suspect.\nLiterally every week ushers in a new round of witch hunts in search of domestic Kremlin agents and new evidence of excessive Putin sympathies. The latest outburst was last night\u2019s discovery that Donald Trump allowed himself to be interviewed by well-known Kremlin propagandist and America-hater Larry King on his RT show. \u201cCriticizing US on Russian TV is something no American, much less an aspiring prez, should do,\u201d pronounced Fred Kaplan. Other guests appearing on that network include Soviet spy Bernard Sanders (who spoke this year to Putin crony and RT host Ed Schultz), Bill Maher (whose infiltrates American culture through his cover as a comedian hosting an HBO program), and Stephen Hawking (whom the FSB has groomed to masquerade as a \u201cphysicist\u201d while he carries out un-American activities on behalf of Putin).\nDespite the fact that Russia ceased long ago to be guided by anything resembling communism, this linking of one\u2019s political adversaries to the Kremlin is such a potent tactic in the U.S. because of decades of Cold War rhetoric about Moscow. Referring to Putin, Matt Lauer this week asked Trump: \u201cDo you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?\u201d Denouncing Trump\u2019s praise of Putin, Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel called the Russian president \u201ca communist leader that\u2019s a potential enemy!\u201d Explaining why Trump\u2019s comments about Russia are so remarkable, the New York Times contended that \u201cMr. Trump has made improved relations with the Kremlin a centerpiece of his candidacy\u201d in \u201ca fashion that would have been unheard-of for a Republican during or immediately after the Cold War.\u201d\nThere are all sorts of glaring ironies, and glaring dangers, to this new theme \u2014 including the fact that \u201cimproved relations with the Kremlin\u201d was a long-time plank of the Democratic Party, which, as a result, was routinely vilified by the American Right as Kremlin agents and sympathizers (as were Republicans such as Nixon and Reagan when they sought better ties with Moscow). But the most glaring irony of all is that as Clinton-led Democrats this year equate overtures toward Russia as evidence of Putin-loving disloyalty \u2014 whether it be Trump\u2019s opposition to arming Ukraine or his heretical questioning of NATO \u2014 there is an American politician who has, time and again, accommodated Putin, sought to improve relations with Moscow, dismissed as fearmongering the threat Russia poses to the U.S., and repeatedly taken steps that benefited Russian interests.\nThat politician\u2019s name is Barack Obama. As Trevor Timm wrote yesterday in The Guardian, \u201cBarack Obama seems to be the only politician not playing into the cold war 2.0 hysteria.\u201d Indeed, Obama has continually acted in accord with Russia\u2019s agenda and sought to pour cold water on attempts to revive Cold War rhetoric and policies.\nEarly last year, U.S. intelligence agencies claimed to have evidence that Russia was making increasingly aggressive military incursions into Ukraine, including with tanks and artillery. Leading foreign policy experts in both parties \u2014 including Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Obama\u2019s own Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin E. Dempsey \u2014 united to pressure President Obama to send arms to Kiev to ward off what they viewed as Russian aggression. But Obama steadfastly refused. Obama\u2019s recalcitrance became so entrenched that a bipartisan alliance in Congress emerged to introduce legislation to force him to provide lethal aid. As the New York Times reported:\nRepresentative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said last week that he was so \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the administration for not using tools in past legislation authorizing more sanctions against Russia and arms for Ukraine that he was introducing a new bill to \u201cdial up the pressure on Vladimir Putin.\u201d\nThe Ukraine debate of 2015 was not the only instance in which President Obama has taken action that accommodated Putin and benefited Russian interests. Last year, Russia began bombing Syria in order to protect its long-time client Bashar Assad. While Hillary Clinton and others advocated imposition of a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d to stop the Russians, Obama did nothing. To the contrary, Obama \u2014 who himself has spent two years bombing the anti-Assad fighters in Syria whom the U.S. government regards as terrorists (killing many civilians in the process) \u2014 is now actively forging a partnership with Putin whereby Russia and the U.S. would jointly bomb agreed-upon targets in Syria (ones opposed to Assad).\nThen there\u2019s Obama\u2019s total passivity in the face of accusations from Democrats and others that Putin has been actively and maliciously interfering in U.S. elections this year through hacking, disinformation, and other subversive measures. For those who really believe these claims, shouldn\u2019t the U.S. president be issuing strong condemnations and taking aggressive retaliatory measures? What has Obama done to punish Putin for these transgressions? By all appearances, he\u2019s done nothing. Max Boot \u2014 who until recently was one of the country\u2019s most discredited neocon extremists but has now once again become a Respectable and Credible Commentator by virtue of endorsing Clinton over Trump \u2014 complained this week about Obama\u2019s submission to Putin:\nEven when hacks can be traced to Russia, it\u2019s very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn\u2019t need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming. \u2026 And yet no action has been forthcoming so far. \u2026\nReflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse. \u2026 So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. \u2026\nIn fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction \u2014 how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?\nSo after acting in Putin\u2019s interests in both Ukraine and Syria, Obama now backs down from challenging or punishing him even when the Russian leader interferes in U.S. elections? The plot does indeed thicken.\nBut perhaps most bizarre of all was the relentless messaging of the Democratic Party under President Obama during the 2012 campaign. All year long, GOP nominee Mitt Romney tried to alert the country of the menace posed by Putin and the Kremlin. Russia \u201cis without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world\u2019s worst actors,\u201d Romney warned.\nFor his patriotic efforts to warn Americans, what did Romney get in response from Obama-led Democrats? Nothing but derision and scorn. During their foreign policy debate, Obama mocked Romney for his Russia-phobia, telling him: \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because \u2026 the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years.\u201d Joe Biden \u201cattacked the former Massachusetts governor for being \u2018one of a small group of Cold War holdovers,\u2019 for naming Russia as a major threat to the United States.\u201d At the DNC convention, John Kerry scoffed at this Russia-as-Villain cartoon: \u201cMitt Romney talks like he\u2019s only seen Russia by watching Rocky IV.\u201d The Democrats even made a campaign poster laughing at Romney\u2019s concerns over Putin:\nLeading Democrats made it a central theme of 2012 that only someone stuck in antiquated, obsolete Cold War thinking could possibly regard Russia as some sort of dangerous or serious threat:\nThe Obama-led Democratic Party of 2012 \u2014 with very suspect motives and possibly suspect loyalties \u2014 tweeted all forms of mockery aimed at Mitt Romney as a result of the GOP nominee\u2019s valiant attempt to warn about the menace of Vladimir Putin:\nRomney, who calls Russia our \"No. 1 geopolitical foe,\" doesn't seem to realize it's the 21st century. #RomneyNotReady http://t.co/xcvhOAFS\n\u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) October 22, 2012\nWhile it\u2019s true that Russia had not yet annexed Crimea, it was accused of doing all sorts of other things by that point that Democrats today hold up as proof of the Kremlin\u2019s evil \u2014 including its incursion into Georgia (2008), its active support of Assad (2012), its imprisonment of Pussy Riot (2012), its alleged poisoning of Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko (2006), its alleged murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya (2006), and the shooting of human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov and journalist Anastasia Baburova (2009). In the face of all that, there were Obama-led Democrats throughout 2012 mercilessly mocking \u2014 as outdated Cold War rhetoric; Hillary Clinton called it \u201cdated\u201d \u2014 the notion that Russia was a serious threat or that Putin ought to be regarded as serious geopolitical foe.\nIt is certainly disturbing to watch Donald Trump express admiration for Putin\u2019s domestic authoritarianism and venerate that as \u201cstrength.\u201d That\u2019s a valid concern, as it reflects \u2014 by his own reckoning \u2014 what Trump is likely to do, or what he wants to do, if he becomes president.\nBut this ongoing attempt to equate a desire for better relations with Russia with disloyalty to America, or to vilify any associations with Moscow as proof of un-American Putin sympathy, is toxic in the extreme. Beyond being dangerous and oppressive, it\u2019s incredibly short-sighted. After all, the politician who, in reality, has most accommodated Vladimir Putin and most eagerly sought to avoid tensions with the Kremlin \u2014 up to and including trying to partner with them to bomb Syria \u2014 happens to be the one currently occupying the Oval Office: a Democrat.",

    "title": "From Russian TV Network, Not So Much Love for Donald Trump",
    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s interview with Larry King on the Russian-government-funded television network RT America is being widely seen in the mainstream U.S. media as evidence of unseemly coziness between Trump and authoritarian Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\nThe interview came after months of claims by Democratic Party officials and news media pundits that the Russian government is trying to get Trump elected.\nRT America has a long history of coverage that benefits the Russian government and is critical of the United States, as many former employees have complained.\nBut there\u2019s one problem with the theory that RT America and the Russian government are fond of Trump: RT America is sometimes more critical of Trump than U.S. media.\nThe interview with King itself was far from a softball event \u2014 with the host pressing Trump on topics from releasing his tax returns to his utter lack of any strategy in the Middle East. And it\u2019s not uncommon to see criticism of Trump on the network.\nHost Lee Camp has called Trump a \u201cmediocre wizard who can magically turn unemployment into racism.\u201d\nFollowing Trump\u2019s immigration speech in Arizona last week \u2014 in which he doubled down on harsh rhetoric after supposedly \u201csoftening\u201d \u2014 RT host Thom Hartmann took Trump to task. \u201cTrump Now Flip Flopping Hourly\u201d read the chyron on the segment, as guest Mark Weisbrot exclaimed, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a coherent position that stays the same, really, from one day to a next on really any of these issues.\u201d Hartmann\u2019s show has repeatedly labeled Trump\u2019s politics as \u201cfascist,\u201d showing little hesitation with using the word compared to mainstream media.\nDuring Trump\u2019s trip to Mexico, anchor Ed Schultz hosted progressive writer and former Texas agricultural commissioner Jim Hightower, who described Trump and the Mexican president as \u201cone president, and one presidential wannabe who have approval ratings down at the mad cow disease level in both of their countries, so they\u2019re both hugging each other up hoping that this actually means something. It\u2019s a freak show.\u201d\nKing, who has a well-earned reputation for being an easy interview, actually pushed back when Trump said he\u2019ll release his tax returns only once an audit of them is completed. \u201cWhy does the audit, it just confuses me. All you have to do is release the first three pages which is not part of the audit, it just states income, what taxes you paid,\u201d King protested.\nTrump\u2019s claim that he has a secret plan to tackle ISIS also elicited King\u2019s scorn. \u201cYou said that you\u2019ve got a plan on ISIS and you don\u2019t want to reveal it because you don\u2019t want the enemy to know. Nixon said the same thing about Vietnam, but there really was no plan,\u201d King also noted.\nUnlike NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer, King was not afraid to interrupt Trump to correct him.\nTrump said about Iraq: \u201cOnce you go in, you gotta go out the right way, and Obama just took everybody out and it was like a shock to the system, and ultimately ISIS developed and now we have them in 26 to 28 countries and it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d\n\u201cThe timetable was arranged by Bush for the leaving,\u201d King corrected him.\n\u201cWell, you know what, let\u2019s look to the future,\u201d Trump said.\nKing\u2019s last question to Trump caused the interview to end altogether.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get something clear, because I know you a long time. On this immigration issue, what are your feelings about Mexican immigrants. What in your gut about \u2014 what do you feel about this?\u201d King asked.\nTrump offered no response, and the line went silent.\n\u201cDonald are you there?\u201d King asked aloud.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened there, we did not lose the connection,\u201d he told his audience.\nKing and Trump\u2019s relationship goes back decades, but the host has already said he won\u2019t be voting for his old acquaintance.\nOn Friday, the Trump campaign insisted Trump did not know the interview would end up on the Russian-funded network.\nRT America for its part ran an article on Friday noting that the media networks that complained about Trump\u2019s interview with King are owned by corporate conglomerates and Trump foes.",

    "content": "U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning began a hunger strike in military prison Friday, her attorneys confirmed.\n\u201cI need help. I am not getting any,\u201d Manning wrote in a statement. \u201cI was driven to suicide by the lack of care for my gender dysphoria that I have been desperate for. I didn\u2019t get any. I still haven\u2019t gotten any.\u201d\nManning announced her identity as a transgender woman on Aug. 22, 2013, a day after she was sentenced to 35 years in military prison.\nAfter attempting to commit suicide in July, Manning was informed by military officials that she was being investigated for \u201cresisting the force cell move team,\u201d \u201cprohibited property,\u201d and \u201cconduct which threatens.\u201d She is facing indefinite solitary confinement, or a return to maximum-security detention.\nStarting on Friday, Manning said, she would not willingly consume any food or drink, except water and prescribed medications.\nManning also refused to \u201cvoluntarily cut or shorten her hair in any way.\u201d Army officials repeatedly force Manning to cut her hair to \u201cmilitary standards\u201d \u2013 an appearance that she says does not reflect her gender identity.\nHuman rights advocates have repeatedly raised concerns about Manning\u2019s treatment in prison. After her arrest in 2010, she was subjected to solitary confinement for extended periods and repeatedly stripped naked in her cell. Her treatment was so bad that a State Department spokesperson spoke out against the Pentagon and described it as \u201cridiculous and counterproductive and stupid.\u201d\nSince her conviction, Manning has been repeatedly threatened with indefinite solitary confinement, for charges as frivolous as keeping an expired tube of toothpaste in her cell.\nAccording to Manning\u2019s statement Friday, she also filed a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d letter with the prison\u2019s medical team, which includes any attempt to force-feed her medically.\nIn January 2010, Manning sent hundreds of thousands of documents to Wikileaks about the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, revealing a dramatically higher number of civilian casualties than the Pentagon publicly acknowledged. The documents also included a video of Apache attack helicopters gunning down two journalists in Baghdad.\nManning was convicted of six counts of espionage in military court in 2013. Because she was indicted under the Espionage Act, she was not allowed to cite the public interest value of her disclosures as a defense. Manning\u2019s lawyers appealed her conviction in May, calling it \u201cgrossly unfair and unprecedented.\u201d\nManning has written numerous opinion columns in The Guardian from prison.\n[Disclosure: First Look Media Works, Inc., publisher of The Intercept, made a $50,000 matching-fund donation to Chelsea Manning\u2019s legal defense fund through its Press Freedom Litigation Fund, and Glenn Greenwald, a co-founding editor of The Intercept, donated $10,000.]",

    "title": "Who\u2019s Left at Guant\u00e1namo? Fates of Dozens of Prisoners Are Undecided",
    "content": "The last Guant\u00e1namo detainee to make the case for his release before a panel of senior administration officials is also the youngest man left at the island prison.\nIn a hearing Thursday of Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s Periodic Review Board, Hassan Ali Bin Attash, a Yemeni who is believed to be about 31 years old, said through representatives that he was working toward a high school GED diploma and hoped to join relatives in Saudi Arabia and find a job as a translator.\nAttash\u2019s exact birthdate is uncertain, but he was certainly a young teen in 1997, when the U.S. military alleges that he pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden and began working for senior al Qaeda figures doing everything from bomb-making to logistics. He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and spent the next two years being moved between CIA black-site prisons and interrogations in Afghanistan and Jordan before landing in Guant\u00e1namo in September 2004. While in U.S. custody, according to his own and other prisoners\u2019 accounts, he was subjected to sleep deprivation, hung from a bar by his wrists, and threatened with dogs and electric shocks, among other forms of torture. He was also severely tortured by the Jordanians.\nThe military assessment filed for the board states that in Saudi Arabia, Attash could easily reconnect with terrorist actors, and that his family is also suspect. Attash\u2019s older brother Walid bin Attash is one of the five men being tried before the Guant\u00e1namo military commission for the 9/11 attacks.\nHis lawyer, David Remes, countered that allegation, saying that he has never heard the younger Attash express anti-American or extremist views.\n\u201cNow a young man, with a mind of his own, he is no longer under the sway of others and can make independent decisions,\u201d Remes told the board.\nAs with all hearings before the Periodic Review Board \u2014 a sort of parole process for Guant\u00e1namo detainees \u2014 the proceedings were piped by video from Cuba to media and other observers in a room at the Pentagon. Attash, who has previously been seen in photos in an orange jumpsuit with wild hair, appeared as a neatly groomed young man. Detainees are not allowed to speak during the open portion of the hearing.\nAttash\u2019s hearing marks the end of a three-year process in which the Obama administration has reconsidered the cases of many of the last men left at Guant\u00e1namo, with the aim of closing the prison before the president leaves office. As of today, all of the detainees who were eligible for a Periodic Review Board hearing have had one.\nThe final hearing provides an opportunity to look at the 61 men left in Guant\u00e1namo and what the administration proposes to do with them.\nTwenty men are now approved for transfer to another country. Seven are currently facing charges at the military commissions, Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s war court (this includes the five accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks). One remaining detainee has already been convicted by the war court, and two others pleaded guilty. Another 12, including Hassan Attash, have had their hearing but are still awaiting the board\u2019s decision.\nNineteen fall into the intractable category of prisoners who have not been referred for prosecution, but whom officials believe they cannot safely release. The board recommended these men for \u201ccontinued detention under the law of war\u201d \u2014 in other words, slating them for indefinite detention.\n\u201cIn the next few months, it will be interesting to see whether the administration uses all of its powers to release the many men left who are not yet cleared but who it has no intention of charging,\u201d said Shayana Kadidal, senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents many detainees. \u201cThat will show whether the president is genuinely committed to closing the prison or just intends to leave his own unfinished promises for the next president to resolve.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s effort to classify detainees has evolved over the years. After Obama\u2019s year-one promise to close Guant\u00e1namo, he convened a task force to evaluate the cases of all the detainees there, recommending them for prosecution, continued detention, or transfer to another country.\nObama also established the Periodic Review Boards (known in Gitmo lingo as PRBs) to regularly evaluate the situation of each detainee the task force had recommended for detention or trial, in order to determine whether they still pose a threat to the United States or if they could be safely released. The board includes representatives from the departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Justice, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence. They don\u2019t take up the legality of holding the prisoner. Instead, they consider the intelligence against the detainee, and whether it still holds up, as well as the detainee\u2019s behavior and activities. They also consider what life after Guant\u00e1namo would look like \u2014 family and other support networks, job prospects, and the stability of their home country.\nAs such, the review boards offer a rare glimpse into life at the prison, with detainees often submitting personal details, reports from vocational or language classes, or even paintings. Remes, Attash\u2019s lawyer, said that \u201cwhen the prison still made such publications as the Washington Post and New York Times available to detainees, Hassan devoured them.\u201d (A Guant\u00e1namo public affairs officer would not comment on whether those newspapers were allowed but said that the \u201cintellectual stimulation program\u201d for detainees \u201cincludes books, magazines and puzzles, newspapers, handheld electronic games, movies and satellite television.\u201d)\nThe administration has been criticized for the slow start to the PRB process; the first hearing didn\u2019t happen until 2013. This year, as the prison\u2019s population dipped below 100 for the first time, the pace of the PRBs sped up.\nWhen someone is cleared for transfer, the administration has to find a place to resettle him, which is particularly tricky when his home country isn\u2019t an option (many of the remaining men are from Yemen, which is currently embroiled in a devastating war).\nThe prisoners slated for indefinite detention present a bigger conundrum. Each prisoner may have his PRB file reviewed every six months, and after three years (if the regime at Guant\u00e1namo continues) he\u2019d be eligible for another hearing. One detainee is already scheduled for his second PRB hearing in October.\nThe Pentagon says that whatever the decision of the PRB, the administration can continue to evaluate \u201cindividualized disposition\u201d options, including transfer, prosecution in the military commissions or by another country, or, should Congress lift the current ban on bringing Guant\u00e1namo inmates to the United States, imprisoning them or trying them domestically (recent court decisions have limited the types of charges the military tribunals can bring).\nIn other cases, the detainees are unlikely to be tried because the evidence against them is tainted by torture (already an issue in other military commissions proceedings) or because there simply isn\u2019t much evidence against them at all, said Kadidal, of the Center for Constitutional Rights. \u201cMost of these men are in fact not people who are worthy of prosecution,\u201d he said.\nIf the U.S. government continues to assert that it can hold them under the law of war, Kadidal said, \u201cwe can expect continued challenges\u201d in federal court questioning whether the conflicts justifying the detentions are really still taking place.\n\u201cIf not, continued detention is illegal,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "The Intercept Brasil foi criado para fazer mat\u00e9rias de relev\u00e2ncia, indiferente a quem possa n\u00e3o gostar. Por isso, n\u00e3o foi uma surpresa ver que a mat\u00e9ria que publicamos na semana passada, analisando os cortes dr\u00e1sticos nos 11 principais programas sociais do governo na primeira proposta or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria apresentada por Michel Temer, foi criticada por grupos da direita que apoiam suas reformas em favor de grandes industriais e \u201ceconomias livres\u201d. A surpresa veio na forma da ferocidade junto com a completa falta de base das acusa\u00e7\u00f5es, jogando contra nosso trabalho.\nO editor de um site direito-libert\u00e1rio, o \u201cInstituto Mercado Popular\u201d (IMP), assinou um post na p\u00e1gina de Facebook deles, divulgado a seus 35 mil seguidores, chamando nossa an\u00e1lise, que comparava a proposta de Temer com a de Dilma Rousseff no ano anterior, de \u201cporca\u201d e \u201ctudo mentira\u201d. Ele chegou a essa conclus\u00e3o porque \u201caquele projeto de or\u00e7amento [de Rousseff] era uma ilus\u00e3o, e o gasto efetivo nessas \u00e1reas foi menor\u201d. Ou seja, que a proposta or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria de 2016 era irrelevante porque os gastos verdadeiros em \u00e1reas sociais eram muito inferiores, criando a \u201cfalsa conclus\u00e3o\u201d de que Temer est\u00e1 propondo grandes cortes nessas \u00e1reas. O IMP n\u00e3o cita nenhum n\u00famero, fonte, c\u00e1lculo ou link relevante para apoiar sua conclus\u00e3o, apenas diz. (O post tamb\u00e9m foi replicado na \u00edntegra com o titulo \u201cGlenn engana\u201d pelo site \u201cO Antagonista\u201d, liderado pelo polemista da extrema-direita e ex-colunista da Veja, Diogo Mainardi.)\nA an\u00e1lise original foi conduzida com o mesmo profissionalismo de sempre por Breno Costa, habituado a lidar com esse tipo de material desde a \u00e9poca em que era rep\u00f3rter de pol\u00edtica na Folha de S.Paulo, por exemplo. (Vale a pena notar a ironia com que o IMP e O Antagonista personalizaram suas acusa\u00e7\u00f5es de falta de rigor profissional contra o editor co-fundador do The Intercept, Glenn Greenwald, que n\u00e3o escreveu ou editou o texto em quest\u00e3o \u2013 at\u00e9 porque n\u00e3o tem essa fun\u00e7\u00e3o.)\nVamos aos n\u00fameros.\nDesde que o Or\u00e7amento de 2016 foi aprovado e implementado, de acordo com um levantamento via Siafi (conforme dados dispon\u00edveis para consulta p\u00fablica no sistema Siga Brasil, gerenciado pelo Senado Federal), houve, sim, R$ 2,18 bilh\u00f5es em redu\u00e7\u00f5es de gastos no conjunto dos 11 programas sociais destacados inicialmente pelo The Intercept Brasil. Mas R$ 953 milh\u00f5es (ou 43,6%) foram cortados nos tr\u00eas meses da interinidade de Michel Temer. O corte total nessas \u00e1reas foi de 1,17% de tudo o que havia sido projetado, inicialmente, pelo governo Dilma Rousseff, e 1,16% do que foi aprovado pelo Congresso em n\u00fameros nominais.\nDesta vez, n\u00e3o gastamos nosso tempo corrigindo esses n\u00fameros para considerar a taxa de infla\u00e7\u00e3o no per\u00edodo, pois \u00e9 sexta-feira, e a diferen\u00e7a \u00e9 t\u00e3o esmagadora que a natureza difamat\u00f3ria e mal-informada do cr\u00edtico do IMP fica evidente. Para quem n\u00e3o leu nossa mat\u00e9ria, o governo Temer prop\u00f5e um corte de R$ 29,2 bilh\u00f5es (corrigido para infla\u00e7\u00e3o) nos mesmos 11 programas \u2014 uma queda real de 14% e uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o media de 30% por programa. Essa diferen\u00e7a de dezenas de bilh\u00f5es de reais \u00e9 o que qualquer observador s\u00f3brio chamaria de \u201ccortes marcados\u201d.\nOutro ponto que o editor do Instituto Mercado Popular traz em seu post de Facebook, com bastante destaque, \u00e9 que houve varia\u00e7\u00f5es nas previs\u00f5es de crescimento do PIB em 2016 e 2017 que impactaram negativamente a economia e a arrecada\u00e7\u00e3o de impostos. O fato \u00e9 que a reportagem verificou, com base nas duas propostas or\u00e7ament\u00e1rias, que o montante total de despesas do Or\u00e7amento Fiscal e da Seguridade Social programadas para 2017 \u00e9 4,8% maior (j\u00e1 descontada a infla\u00e7\u00e3o) do que o previsto por Dilma no momento da sua proposta or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria ao Congresso, no ano passado.\nOu seja, a grande quest\u00e3o, aqui, \u00e9 entender por que h\u00e1 uma proje\u00e7\u00e3o (significativa) de menos recursos para os programas sociais listados, enquanto, dentro desse mesmo bolo, a fatia de \u00e1reas como defesa, agroneg\u00f3cio, pol\u00edtica espacial e pol\u00edtica nuclear, entre outros, apresenta crescimento. A base de recursos \u00e9 a mesma. Por que, afinal, houve mudan\u00e7a no tamanho das fatias? \u00c9 uma simples e leg\u00edtima quest\u00e3o de prioridades (embora fosse muito mais leg\u00edtima se os eleitores tivessem votado por um governo que fosse seguir nessa linha).\nTamb\u00e9m \u00e9 importante deixar claro para quem ainda estiver interessado no assunto que, com todo o crit\u00e9rio jornal\u00edstico que temos por obriga\u00e7\u00e3o e pelo nosso prazer em trabalhar, tivemos o cuidado de:\n- Comparar a proposta de Or\u00e7amento n\u00e3o com a lei aprovada pelo Congresso ou mesmo com os valores efetivamente autorizados ao longo da execu\u00e7\u00e3o or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria deste ano, mas, sim, com a proposta de or\u00e7amento apresentada exatamente um ano atr\u00e1s pelo governo Dilma, como explicam os primeiros par\u00e1grafos da mat\u00e9ria. N\u00e3o comparamos alhos com bugalhos.\n- Corrigirmos os valores considerando a infla\u00e7\u00e3o do per\u00edodo, referente aos pre\u00e7os de mercado (IGP-M). Afinal, n\u00e3o estamos falando de algo que custa R$ 10 hoje e que passar\u00e1 a custar um real a mais dali a um ano. Estamos falando de coisas de R$ 5 bilh\u00f5es que viram algo, em m\u00e9dia, R$ 550 milh\u00f5es mais caras.\n- Deixarmos claro no t\u00edtulo, assim como no gr\u00e1fico publicado, que o Or\u00e7amento apresentado era uma \u201cproposta\u201d, n\u00e3o o Or\u00e7amento final, assim como foi no caso de Dilma. O t\u00edtulo da reportagem \u00e9 \u201cTemer pede\u201d. Al\u00e9m disso, a reportagem termina com esta observa\u00e7\u00e3o, que reafirmamos aqui:\n\u201cToda essa numeralha envolve apenas a proposta inicial de gastos. Esses valores ser\u00e3o trabalhados no Congresso e podem aumentar ou, considerando o perfil da base aliada, diminuir ainda mais. Al\u00e9m disso, na execu\u00e7\u00e3o do Or\u00e7amento ao longo do ano que vem, o governo poder\u00e1 promover diretamente o chamado contingenciamento de recursos \u2013 ou, traduzindo, fazer ainda mais cortes naquilo que j\u00e1 foi cortado.\u201d\nImaginamos que o IMP tenha parado de ler a reportagem antes do final.\nPoder\u00edamos continuar, mas parece que uma acusa\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o rasa n\u00e3o merece mais do nosso tempo, nem o seu.\nSeria interessante, entretanto, saber por que os integrantes do Instituto Mercado Popular n\u00e3o pegam as \u00edntegras das propostas or\u00e7ament\u00e1rias de 2016 e 2017 e produzem um texto para o seu p\u00fablico a respeito dos n\u00fameros, indicando onde, exatamente, existe uma perspectiva de melhoria nos recursos que estar\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis para os principais programas sociais. Talvez j\u00e1 se consiga deduzir a resposta.\nAgora, vale a pena analisar quem \u00e9 que acusou o The Intercept Brasil de publicar \u201cmentiras ideologicamente motivadas\u201d.\nO escritor, Pedro Menezes, \u00e9 editor do blog do Instituto Mercado Popular (IMP) e estudante do curso de gradua\u00e7\u00e3o de economia no Insper, de acordo com sua biografia no site. O IMP, um grupo com oito integrantes listado no seu site, acredita que o liberalismo econ\u00f4mico \u00e9 o caminho mais adequado para garantir bem-estar aos mais pobres e cita Adam Smith na abertura de seu manifesto ao p\u00fablico. \u00c9 uma de v\u00e1rias novas organiza\u00e7\u00f5es e \u201cthink tanks\u201d no Brasil com nomes pomposos, fundado por integrantes de um movimento da extrema direita criado e orientado nos EUA.\nGeralmente, entre esses grupos, existem uma a abund\u00e2ncia de coliga\u00e7\u00f5es para que um grupo pequeno possa estrategicamente criar a ilus\u00e3o de um amplo movimento \u201cgrassroots\u201d, torcendo exatamente para os tipos de reformas que o governo Temer e seus apoiadores est\u00e3o tentando implementar (com o b\u00f4nus de quase todo mundo envolvido poder botar no curr\u00edculo ser \u201cco-fundador\u201d de X e \u201cdiretor\u201d de Y e talvez ganhar uma bolsa para fazer um treinamento nos EUA). O IMP foi fundado em 2013 exclusivamente por membros do grupo Estudantes pela Liberdade, que \u00e9 o ber\u00e7o, entre outros, do l\u00edder do Movimento Brasil Livre, Kim Kataguiri.\nO \u201cEstudantes pela Liberdade\u201d, por sua vez, \u00e9 descendente direto do americano \u201cStudents for Liberty\u201d, uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o surgida em 2008 com o apoio de entidades conservadoras dos EUA, entre eles os irm\u00e3os Charles e David Koch, apoiadores de v\u00e1rias causas neoliberais, libert\u00e1rias, anti-regula\u00e7\u00e3o e pro-industria e que est\u00e3o, ambos, entre os dez homens mais ricos do mundo.

    "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s View of Military Sexual Assault Is Chauvinistic \u2014 and Not Uncommon",
    "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s latest attempt to deflect criticism about a 2013 tweet in which he blamed the prevalence of sexual assault in the military on the presence of women has been to criticize the military court system for letting offenders go unprosecuted.\nBut a big reason the military court system is so ineffective at punishing sexual assault offenders is precisely because senior members of the chain of command are involved \u2014 and too many share Trump\u2019s view that rape and sexual assault are inevitable given the circumstances.\nThis is the tweet in question:\n26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2013\n\u201cMany in the military would be nodding their heads in agreement in that statement. I would not say the majority, but too many would be,\u201d said Col. Don Christensen, former Air Force chief prosecutor and president of Protect Our Defenders \u2014 an organization dedicated to ending rape and sexual assault in the military \u2014 in an interview with The Intercept.\nTrump defended his views on sexual assault in the military on NBC\u2019s Commander-in-Chief forum on Wednesday.\n\u201cWell, it is \u2014 it is \u2014 it is a correct tweet,\u201d he said.\nNBC\u2019s Matt Lauer asked: \u201cSo this should have been expected? And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?\u201d\nTrump responded: \u201cWell, it\u2019s happening, right? And, by the way, since then, it\u2019s gotten worse. No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen. Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. \u2026 You have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted. There are no consequence.\n\u201cWhen you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person. You have to go after that person. Right now, nobody\u2019s doing anything. Look at the small number of results. I mean, that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d\nOn CNN that night, former Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling echoed Trump\u2019s view that rape in such cases is inevitable. \u201cIt is a problem, and there are ways that the military is fixing that problem,\u201d he said, \u201cbut certainly when you put young people together, these kinds of things happen to a small percentage.\u201d\nActually, in the current system victims often won\u2019t report their assaults. \u201cThe low reporting and conviction rates of sexual violence are complicated. This is partially due to the revictimization of the reporting and judicial process,\u201d wrote activist Melanie Carlson in The Hill.\nSurvivors of sexual assault in the military have been met with retaliation, a 2015 Human Rights Watch report found.\n\u201cI knew when I reported my career would be over. Based on past experience, I knew what would happen,\u201d said Lisa Cox, a Navy petty officer, according to the report.\nTime magazine reported that Army Lt. Emily Vorland was discharged for \u201cunacceptable conduct\u201d after an Army investigation into claims that a higher-ranking male sexually harassed her.\nWhen an individual in the military seeks legal action, the case is brought to a court system where everyone is operating in a chain of command \u2014 something that Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has sought repeatedly to change through legislation.\nChristensen said that sexual assault cases in military court are lengthy and arduous. \u201cI have prosecuted and defended almost every case you can imagine \u2014 sexual assault is the most difficult you can do,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo one should have to suffer the chain of command when they report these crimes,\u201d Gillibrand said last year. \u201cRetaliation happens so often that a majority of these assaults go unreported. Every military victim of sexual assault deserves due process, professional treatment by a trained military official at each opportunity to seek and receive justice.\u201d\nIn 2014, Hillary Clinton announced her support for Gillibrand\u2019s bill in an interview on CNN. \u201cAnd remember, it\u2019s not only women, it\u2019s men who\u2019ve been assaulted as well,\u201d she said.",

    "title": "Fifteen Years After 9/11, Neverending War",
    "content": "In the days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when Congress voted to authorize military force against the people who \u201cplanned, authorized, committed, or aided\u201d the hijackings, few Americans could have imagined the resulting manhunt would span from West Africa all the way to the Philippines, and would outlast two two-term presidents.\nToday, U.S. military engagement in the Middle East looks increasingly permanent. Despite the White House having formally ended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of U.S. troops and contractors remain in both countries. The U.S. is dropping bombs on Iraq and Syria faster than it can make them, and according to the Pentagon, its bombing campaign in Libya has \u201cno end point at this particular moment.\u201d The U.S. is also helping Saudi Arabia wage war in Yemen, in addition to conducting occasional airstrikes in Yemen and Somalia.\nFifteen years after the September 11 attacks, it looks like the war on terror is still in its opening act.\nThe drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan only revealed how little war has achieved and how much damage it has inflicted. In Afghanistan, the Taliban now holds more territory than it has at any point since 2001. One poll from 2016 found that more than 90 percent of young people in Iraq now consider the United States an \u201cenemy\u201d of their country.\nThe Islamic State, which was largely created by the U.S. invasion of Iraq, controls vast swaths of territory in Iraq, Syria, and Libya, and has demonstrated an emboldened capability to orchestrate attacks in Europe. In June, CIA Director John Brennan told Congress that \u201cdespite all our progress against ISIL on the battlefield and in the financial realm, our efforts have not reduced the group\u2019s terrorism capability and global reach.\u201d\nAl Qaeda, the original enemy, today controls territory in Yemen and Somalia, but it is no longer considered a priority. In the span of one year, for example, the U.S.-backed war in Yemen quadrupled the size of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \u2014 the terror group\u2019s most dangerous offshoot. The CIA has continued to arm Syrian rebels, despite the fact that those weapons have found their way to a former al Qaeda affiliate. Retired Gen. David Petraeus, formerly the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, actually suggested arming al Qaeda directly to help fight ISIS.\nDespite the lack of progress, the last 15 years of war have come at a horrific cost.\nThe U.S. lost nearly 2,300 service members in Afghanistan, and nearly 4,500 in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands were forever damaged. Those figures do not include at least 6,900 U.S. contractors and at least 43,000 Afghan and Iraqi troops who lost their lives.\nThe death toll in the countries the U.S. attacked remains untallied, but conservative estimates range from the hundreds of thousands to well over a million. Add to that the hundreds of people tortured in U.S. custody, and thousands killed by U.S. drones in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.\nThe financial cost of the war on terror is incalculable. The Iraq and Afghan wars, including the medical costs for veterans, are estimated to end up costing the U.S. at least $4 trillion dollars. Intelligence budgets have doubled, on top of more than $800 billion spent on \u201chomeland security.\u201d\nBillions of dollars have been wasted on fruitless projects \u2014 like a failed plan to install radiation detectors at airports, which cost the government $230 million. The Department of Homeland Security wasted $1.1 billion on a \u201cvirtual fence\u201d of sensors along the Mexican border before scrapping the program. The examples go on and on. The CIA paid one contractor $20 million to build a program that could discover encoded terrorist messages in Al Jazeera news broadcasts. Just last year, the Pentagon spent $43 million on one gas station in Afghanistan. Two contract psychologists were paid $80 million for designing the CIA\u2019s torture program.\nAfter 15 years, the only winners in the war on terror have been the contractors.\nAt home, the war on terror has become a constitutional nightmare. The U.S. has adopted a practice of indefinitely detaining terror suspects. Police departments across the country secretly import military-grade spy equipment. Courts have ruled that families cannot sue to get their children off government kill lists. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the U.S. has become the largest surveillance state in history.\nIn the 2016 presidential campaigns, torture has become one party\u2019s applause line, in no small part due to President Obama\u2019s failure to prosecute the architects of the Bush-era torture program.\nBombing multiple countries in the Middle East has become business as usual, and often goes unreported. On August 1, for example, the day the Obama administration announced a new bombing campaign against ISIS in Libya, American journalists were far more occupied with post-convention election polls than they were with the new war.\nAll of this foreshadows a war that could stretch 10, 20, or 50 more years. As the U.S. shifts its strategy toward bombing and away from ground troops, media engagement with the wars diminishes, and it is all too easy to forget about our permanent state of war. But the victims of U.S. violence are unlikely to forget, creating a potentially endless supply of new enemies.",

    "content": "Na v\u00e9spera da cerim\u00f4nia de abertura dos Jogos Ol\u00edmpicos, o presidente n\u00e3o-eleito lembrou que, no Maracan\u00e3, \u201cvaia-se at\u00e9 minuto de sil\u00eancio\u201d. A frase de Nelson Rodrigues n\u00e3o poderia ser mais verdadeira. Se at\u00e9 presidentes eleitos foram vaiados, por que um que chegou ao cargo catapultado pela gangue de Eduardo Cunha e implantou um programa de governo rejeitado nas urnas n\u00e3o seria?\nTanto na abertura das Olimp\u00edadas quanto na das Paraolimp\u00edadas, uma Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Passa-Pano foi montada para que vaias e xingamentos n\u00e3o fossem ouvidos na transmiss\u00e3o da TV. Mas n\u00e3o adiantou, o barulho e o constrangimento foram enormes.\nE eu tenho a leve impress\u00e3o de que a opera\u00e7\u00e3o conta com um bra\u00e7o jornal\u00edstico muito eficaz. H\u00e1 um grande empenho das manchetes e do colunismo em minimizar as vaias e os protestos que o presidente vem sofrendo dia sim, dia sim.\nEliane Cantanhede, a colunista da massa cheirosa que chegou a implorar por uma \u201ctr\u00e9gua a Temer\u201d, comentou na abertura das Olimp\u00edadas: \u201cTemer foi vaiado por alguns segundos. E da\u00ed?\u201d.\nO Antagonista de Diogo Mainardi deixou sua famosa agressividade de lado e pediu docemente para o presidente n\u00e3o se incomodar com as vaias.\nA jornalista Mary Zaidan tamb\u00e9m tentou estancar a sangria em seu Twitter: \u201cInsisto: s\u00f3 quem votou em Temer est\u00e1 gritando \u2018Fora, Temer\u2019\u201d. Nessa livre e ousada interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos fatos, apenas quem votou em Dilma deseja a sa\u00edda de Temer. Talvez ela ache que esses eleitores deveriam ter consultado as cartas de tar\u00f4 para descobrir que o vice trairia a plataforma de governo pela qual foi eleito.\nMiriam Leit\u00e3o foi al\u00e9m e terceirizou as vaias de Temer para Dilma. Em coluna na \u201cCBN\u201d intitulada \u201cVaias a Temer s\u00e3o por decis\u00f5es tomadas por Dilma\u201d*, a economista deu sua valorosa contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para a opera\u00e7\u00e3o.\nO Jornal Nacional fez um breve resumo dos protestos em todo pa\u00eds no dia 7 de setembro e destacou que em S\u00e3o Paulo a marcha foi \u201cliderada por mascarados\u201d, numa clara tentativa de desqualificar os protestos.\nO trabalho da opera\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido \u00e1rduo. Em poucos meses como presidente, Michel Temer j\u00e1 possui uma vasta cole\u00e7\u00e3o de vaias. Ele, que para muitos \u00e9 um Dom Pedro contempor\u00e2neo que nos libertou das garras do bolivarianismo e impediu que nossa bandeira se tornasse vermelha, acordou sendo vaiado no desfile de 7 de setembro e foi dormir sendo vaiado na abertura das Paralimp\u00edadas. Conseguiu a fa\u00e7anha de levar pra casa duas enormes vaias no mesmo dia. Quer dizer, segundo a Globo, ele foi vaiado, mas \u201calgumas pessoas aplaudiram\u201d. N\u00e3o foi t\u00e3o ruim assim.\nNos protestos que reuniram milhares de pessoas em todo o Brasil nos dias seguintes ao impeachment, Jos\u00e9 Serra saiu em defesa do seu presida e desdenhou dos manifestantes. Segundo ele, foram atos de \u201cpequenos grupos organizados\u201d, uma minoria que classificou como \u201cmini mini mini mini mini mini\u201d \u2013 seis \u201cminis\u201d.\nO chefe da Casa Civil, Geddel, apontou a irrelev\u00e2ncia do protesto no desfile da Independ\u00eancia: \u201ca dimens\u00e3o \u00e9 de 18 pessoas em 18 mil\u201d.\nQuando foi buscar legitimidade na China, o presidente n\u00e3o-eleito respondeu ao ser perguntado se as manifesta\u00e7\u00f5es poderiam atrapalhar o in\u00edcio de seu governo: \u201cAs 40 pessoas que quebram carro? Precisa perguntar para os 204 milh\u00f5es de brasileiros\u201d.\nBom, uma pesquisa Datafolha de abril j\u00e1 perguntou. E o resultado foi que 58% dos brasileiros defendem o impeachment de Temer. J\u00e1 o Ibope, da mesma \u00e9poca, trouxe um n\u00famero ainda pior: apenas 8% da popula\u00e7\u00e3o quer v\u00ea-lo como presidente do pa\u00eds. De l\u00e1 pra c\u00e1, nada mudou. Nas capitais, a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o de Temer est\u00e1 entre 8% a 19%, segundo pesquisa Ibope divulgada na semana passada.\nParece que o n\u00famero de pessoas insatisfeitas \u00e9 um pouco maior que 40, n\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo? A insatisfa\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o mini mini mini mini e nem parte apenas dos que votaram na chapa Dilma/Temer. Haja pano pra passar!\n\u00c9 importante frisar que a nossa querida imprensa n\u00e3o deixou de registrar as vaias. Ela sempre publica tudo, voc\u00eas j\u00e1 sabem. Peguemos o Estad\u00e3o como exemplo. Foi assim que ele publicou as vaias para Lula, na abertura do Panamericano, e para Dilma, na abertura da Copa do Mundo:\nAgora, quando as vaias foram direcionadas para o seu novo queridinho, o jornalismo do Estad\u00e3o precisou se adequar. Essas foram as capas publicadas nos dias seguintes \u00e0s aberturas das Olimp\u00edadas e Paraolimp\u00edadas:\nO Estad\u00e3o fez bonito e cumpriu com louvor seu papel na Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Passa-Pano. \u00c9 preciso de uma lupa e muita boa vontade para encontrar os protestos contra Temer. Talvez a Fam\u00edlia Mesquita n\u00e3o queira que a massa leitora de manchetes nas bancas de jornais fique sabendo desse rev\u00e9s.\nVamos ver at\u00e9 quando os paninhos continuar\u00e3o sendo passados. Com os protestos ganhando corpo e a rejei\u00e7\u00e3o aumentando, a tend\u00eancia \u00e9 que a sujeira se acumule. E, segundo a l\u00f3gica do pr\u00f3prio Temer, ser\u00e1 muito dif\u00edcil que ele chegue ao fim do seu governo. H\u00e1 um ano, o ent\u00e3o vice-presidente fez a seguinte afirma\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a ex-presidenta: \u201cCom 7% de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o, fica muito dif\u00edcil concluir seu mandato\u201d. Bem, como vimos, a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o de Temer est\u00e1 variando entre 8 a 19% nas capitais.\n*Logo ap\u00f3s a publica\u00e7\u00e3o, o t\u00edtulo da coluna foi trocado e Miriam disse que n\u00e3o foi bem isso o que quis dizer. Acontece. Algum estagi\u00e1rio abusado deve ter trocado o t\u00edtulo a seu bel prazer.\nJ\u00c1 EST\u00c1 ACONTECENDO\nQuando o assunto \u00e9 a ascens\u00e3o da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa \u00e9 uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3 para anos eleitorais.

    "title": "Barbara Lee\u2019s Lone Vote on Sept. 14, 2001, Was as Prescient as It Was Brave and Heroic",
    "content": "Almost immediately after the 9/11 attack, while bodies were still buried in the rubble, George W. Bush demanded from Congress the legal authorization to use military force against those responsible for the attack, which everyone understood would start with an invasion of Afghanistan. The resulting resolution that was immediately cooked up was both vague and broad, providing that \u201cthe President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.\u201d\nDespite this broadness, or because of it, the House of Representatives on September 14 approved the resolution by a vote of 420-1. The Senate approved it the same day by a vote of 98-0. The lone dissenting vote was Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California, who \u2014 three days after the 9/11 attack, in a climate of virtually full-scale homogeneity \u2014 not only voted \u201cno\u201d but stood up on the House floor to deliver this eloquent, unflinching and, as it turns out, extremely prescient explanation for her opposition:\nIn an op-ed she published in the San Francisco Chronicle nine days later, she explained her vote by pointing out that the resolution \u201cwas a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the Sept. 11 events \u2014 anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation\u2019s long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit.\u201d She added: \u201cA rush to launch precipitous military counterattacks runs too great a risk that more innocent men, women, children will be killed.\u201d\nFor her lone stance, Lee was deluged with rancid insults and death threats to the point where she needed around-the-clock bodyguards. She was vilified as \u201canti-American\u201d by numerous outlets including the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Times editorialized on September 18 that \u201cMs. Lee is a long-practicing supporter of America\u2019s enemies \u2014 from Fidel Castro on down\u201d and that \u201cwhile most of the left-wing Democrats spent the week praising President Bush and trying to sound as moderate as possible, Barbara Lee continued to sail under her true colors.\u201d Since then, she has been repeatedly rejected in her bids to join the House Democratic leadership, typically losing to candidates close to Wall Street and in support of militarism. I documented numerous other ugly attacks when I wrote about her for The Guardian in 2013.\nBut beyond the obvious bravery needed to take the stand she took, she has been completely vindicated on the merits. Close to a majority of Americans now believes that the first war the AUMF was invoked to launch \u2014 the one in Afghanistan \u2014 was a mistake. Fifteen years later, the very same AUMF continues to be used by the Obama administration for all sorts of wars that plainly have nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks \u2014 including its newfound bombing partnership with Russia in Syria. Under this resolution, Obama has bombed seven predominantly Muslim countries in seven years; a 2013 memo from the Congressional Research Service, requested by Lee, listed all the military actions and related abuses undertaken purportedly under its authority:\nIt\u2019s impossible to overstate how correct Lee was when she warned that this resolution would constitute \u201ca blank check\u201d to wage war \u201canywhere, in any country,\u201d and \u201cwithout time limit.\u201d Fifteen years later, this \u201cwar\u201d is raging as destructively as ever, with no end in sight. Indeed, as my Intercept colleague Alex Emmons documented today, \u201cFifteen years after the September 11 attacks, it looks like the war on terror is still in its opening act.\u201d Either one of the two leading presidential candidates is certain to use this resolution for all new expressions of this war.\nLee has never given up on this cause, repeatedly attempting to lead a repeal of the AUMF, though \u2014 in the face of opposition from two successive administrations, one from each party \u2014 she has never been able to convince her colleagues to do so. While her \u201cblank check\u201d warning turned out to be incredibly prescient, the other warning she issued, from the House floor on September 14, was even more profound: \u201cLet us not become the evil we deplore.\u201d\nThe 9/11 attack killed close to 3,000 innocent people, but the 15 years of wars, bombings, invasions, occupations, and other abuses it spawned \u2014 the bulk of which are still raging \u2014 have killed many, many more than that. Americans love to memorialize the victims of the 9/11 attacks, though the abundant victims of their own government\u2019s actions (both leading up to 9/11 and in response to it) are typically ignored. Whatever else 9/11 is used to commemorate, Barbara Lee\u2019s visionary warnings and solitary courage should always be near the top of that list.",

    "content": "Pharmaceutical executives who recently made a major donation to an anti-marijuana legalization campaign claimed they were doing so out of concern for the safety of children \u2014 but their investor filings reveal that pot poses a direct threat to their plans to cash in on a synthetic cannabis product they have developed.\nOn August 31, Insys Therapeutics Inc. donated $500,000 to Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, becoming the single largest donor to the group leading the charge to defeat a ballot measure in Arizona to legalize marijuana.\nThe drug company, which currently markets a fast-acting version of the deadly painkiller fentanyl, assured local news reporters that they had the public interest in mind when making the hefty donation. A spokesperson told the Arizona Republic that Insys opposes the legalization measure, Prop. 205, \u201cbecause it fails to protect the safety of Arizona\u2019s citizens, and particularly its children.\u201d\nA Washington Post story on Friday noted the potential self-interest involved in Insys\u2019s donation.\nInvestor filings examined by The Intercept confirm the obvious.\nInsys is currently developing a product called the Dronabinol Oral Solution, a drug that uses a synthetic version of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate chemotherapy-caused nausea and vomiting. In an early filing related to the dronabinol drug, assessing market concerns and competition, Insys filed a disclosure statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating plainly that legal marijuana is a direct threat to their product line:\nLegalization of marijuana or non-synthetic cannabinoids in the United States could significantly limit the commercial success of any dronabinol product candidate. \u2026 If marijuana or non-synthetic cannabinoids were legalized in the United States, the market for dronabinol product sales would likely be significantly reduced and our ability to generate revenue and our business prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nInsys explains in the filing that dronabinol is \u201cone of a limited number of FDA-approved synthetic cannabinoids in the United States\u201d and \u201ctherefore in the United States, dronabinol products do not have to compete with natural cannabis or non-synthetic cannabinoids.\u201d\nThe company concedes that scientific literature has argued the benefits of marijuana over synthetic dronabinol, and that support for marijuana legalization is growing. In the company\u2019s latest 10-K filing with the SEC, in a section outlining competitive threats, Insys warns that several states \u201chave already enacted laws legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana.\u201d\nSubsys, the fentanyl spray Insys makes, is used as a fast-acting pain reliever. Fentanyl is an opioid that has made headlines in recent years as the number of Americans overdosing on the drug has skyrocketed. Fenatyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and has been linked to the death of Prince earlier this year. Last month, two Insys executives pled guilty to a pay-for-play scheme to use speakers fees as a way to get doctors to prescribe Subsys.\nMarijuana advocates claim that legalized pot has a variety of medical uses, including pain relief.\nIt\u2019s not the first time pharmaceutical companies have helped bankroll the opposition to marijuana reform. Thereceived corporate sponsorship from Purdue Pharma, the makers of Oxycontin, and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, another opioid manufacturer.\nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalition of America, a nonprofit that organizes anti-marijuana activism across the country, has longJ.P. Holyoak, chairman of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a group supporting the legalization ballot measure, released a statement condemning the Insys donation. \u201cOur opponents have made a conscious decision to associate with this company,\u201d Holyoak said. \u201cThey are now funding their campaign with profits from the sale of opioids \u2014 and maybe even the improper sale of opioids.\u201d",

    "content": "Imediatamente depois do ataque de 11 de setembro, enquanto os cad\u00e1veres ainda se encontravam sob os escombros, George W. Bush exigiu autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Congresso para utilizar for\u00e7a militar contra os respons\u00e1veis pelo ataque, que evidentemente seria utilizada para justificar a invas\u00e3o do Afeganist\u00e3o. A resolu\u00e7\u00e3o que foi criada por consequ\u00eancia era vaga, abrangente e estipulava:\n\u201cO presidente est\u00e1 autorizado a usar todo o tipo de for\u00e7a necess\u00e1ria e adequada contra as na\u00e7\u00f5es, organiza\u00e7\u00f5es ou pessoas que ele constatar terem planejado, autorizado, cometido ou auxiliado os ataques terroristas ocorridos em 11 de setembro de 2001, ou que tenham abrigado tais organiza\u00e7\u00f5es ou pessoas.\u201d\nApesar de sua abrang\u00eancia, ou por conta dela, a C\u00e2mara dos Deputados aprovou a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o em 14 de setembro, por 420 a 1. A resolu\u00e7\u00e3o foi aprovada pelo Senado no mesmo dia, por 98 votos a 0. O \u00fanico voto de dissid\u00eancia veio da deputada democrata pela Calif\u00f3rnia, Barbara Lee, que, apenas tr\u00eas dias depois do ataque de 11 de setembro, em um ambiente de unanimidade praticamente absoluta, votou contra a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o e, al\u00e9m disso, subiu ao p\u00falpito da C\u00e2mara para proferir uma justificativa aos seus opositores de forma eloquente, resoluta e, conforme ficou comprovado, extremamente presciente:\nEm um editorial publicado nove dias depois no San Francisco Chronicle, a deputada explicou seu voto, salientando que a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o \u201cera um cheque em branco para que o presidente pudesse atacar qualquer envolvido nos acontecimentos de 11 de setembro \u2014 em qualquer lugar, em qualquer pa\u00eds, independente de nossos interesses econ\u00f4micos, da seguran\u00e7a nacional e de nossa pol\u00edtica externa a longo prazo, al\u00e9m de n\u00e3o ter um limite de tempo\u201d. Ela acrescentou: \u201cA pressa em iniciar contra-ataques militares precipitados gera um risco consider\u00e1vel de que mais homens, mulheres e crian\u00e7as inocentes percam suas vidas.\u201d\n\u201cVamos parar por apenas um minuto e pensar nas consequ\u00eancias de nossas a\u00e7\u00f5es de hoje, para que n\u00e3o percamos o controle.\u201d\nMas, al\u00e9m do reconhecimento pela coragem evidentemente necess\u00e1ria para tomar a posi\u00e7\u00e3o que tomou, a hist\u00f3ria fez jus ao seu posicionamento com base no m\u00e9rito. Quase metade dos americanos cr\u00ea que a primeira guerra (Afeganist\u00e3o) que se valeu da Autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o para Uso de For\u00e7a Militar (Authorization for Use of Military Force \u2013 AUMF) foi um erro. Quinze anos depois, a mesma AUMF continua a ser usada pelo Governo de Obama para justificar diversos tipos de guerras que n\u00e3o t\u00eam nada a ver com os ataques de 11 de setembro \u2014 incluindo sua parceria recentemente revelada com a R\u00fassia na S\u00edria. Valendo-se dessa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o, Obama bombardeou sete pa\u00edses predominantemente mu\u00e7ulmanos em sete anos; um memorando de 2013 do Servi\u00e7o de Pesquisa do Congresso (CRS), solicitado por Lee, listou todas as a\u00e7\u00f5es e abusos militares supostamente realizados sob a autoridade da resolu\u00e7\u00e3o:\nN\u00e3o se pode subestimar o n\u00edvel de precis\u00e3o do posicionamento de Lee ao alertar que essa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o representaria um \u201ccheque em branco\u201d para declarar guerras \u201cem qualquer lugar, em qualquer pa\u00eds\u201d, \u201csem limite de tempo\u201d. Quinze anos depois, essa \u201cguerra\u201d continua sendo mais destrutiva do que nunca, sem um fim \u00e0 vista. Certamente, conforme meu colega do The Intercept, Alex Emmons, documentou neste domingo, \u201c15 anos depois dos ataques de 11 de setembro, parece que a guerra ao terror ainda de encontra em seu primeiro ato\u201d. \u00c9 certo que qualquer um dos dois candidatos \u00e0 presid\u00eancia usar\u00e1 a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o para as novas ramifica\u00e7\u00f5es dessa mesma guerra.Lee n\u00e3o desistiu de sua causa, tentando in\u00fameras vezes liderar uma revoga\u00e7\u00e3o da AUMF, mas, devido \u00e0 oposi\u00e7\u00e3o de dois governos consecutivos (um de cada partido), n\u00e3o conseguiu obter o apoio de seus colegas. Ainda que seu alerta a respeito do \u201ccheque em branco\u201d tenha sido extremamente presciente, o outro alerta que deu, em 14 de setembro, no p\u00falpito da C\u00e2mara, foi ainda mais profundo: \u201cN\u00e3o nos tornemos o mal que deploramos.\u201d\nOs ataques de 11 de setembro mataram quase 3 mil pessoas, mas os 15 anos de guerras bombardeios, invas\u00f5es, ocupa\u00e7\u00f5es e outros abusos \u2014 em sua grande maioria, ainda em curso \u2014 fizeram muito mais v\u00edtimas do que isso. Os americanos adoram homenagear as v\u00edtimas dos ataques de 11 de setembro, mas o abundante n\u00famero de v\u00edtimas resultante das a\u00e7\u00f5es de seu pr\u00f3prio governo (tanto antes quanto depois de 11 de setembro) geralmente \u00e9 ignorado. Independente do que \u00e9 comemorado em 11 de setembro, os alertas vision\u00e1rios e a coragem solit\u00e1ria de Barbara Lee devem sempre se encontrar entre os primeiros da lista.\nJ\u00c1 EST\u00c1 ACONTECENDO\nQuando o assunto \u00e9 a ascens\u00e3o da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa \u00e9 uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3 para anos eleitorais. Mas o projeto de poder bolsonarista nunca dorme.\nA grande m\u00eddia, o agro, as for\u00e7as armadas, as megaigrejas e as big techs bilion\u00e1rias ganharam for\u00e7a nas elei\u00e7\u00f5es municipais \u2014 e t\u00eam uma vantagem enorme para 2026.\nN\u00e3o podemos ficar alheios enquanto somos arrastados para o retrocesso, afogados em fuma\u00e7a t\u00f3xica e privados de direitos b\u00e1sicos. J\u00e1 passou da hora de agir. Juntos.\nA meta ousada do Intercept para 2025 \u00e9 nada menos que derrotar o golpe em andamento antes que ele conclua sua miss\u00e3o. Para isso, dependemos do apoio de nossos leitores.\nVoc\u00ea est\u00e1 pronto para combater a m\u00e1quina bilion\u00e1ria da extrema direita ao nosso lado? Fa\u00e7a uma doa\u00e7\u00e3o hoje mesmo.",

    "title": "Foreign Spending on U.S. Elections Threatens National Security, FEC Commissioner Says",
    "content": "Calling foreign influence on U.S. elections \u201ca matter of national security,\u201d FEC commissioner Ellen Weintraub is joining her colleague Ann Ravel in calling for the full commission to plug the flow of foreign money into American political campaigns.\nIn a new memo to her five fellow commissioners, Weintraub writes that the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision created \u201cnew avenues for corporate political activity would make our democracy vulnerable to foreign individuals, corporations, and governments that seek to manipulate our elections.\u201d Weintraub will ask the full FEC at its meeting on Thursday to begin the process of writing new regulations to deal with Citizens United and foreign money.\nWeintraub cites recent reporting by The Intercept on a $1.3 million donation by a U.S. corporation owned by Chinese citizens to a Super PAC backing Jeb Bush as evidence that this is not a \u201chypothetical\u201d issue. \u201cA person would have to be wearing some very rose-colored glasses,\u201d Weintraub writes, \u201cto think there are not foreign operatives interested in exploiting any vulnerability to influence our elections.\u201d\nHer fellow commissioner Ann Ravel called on the FEC to take action in August, in the wake of The Intercept\u2019s story.\nThe Citizens United decision opened up a peculiar loophole for foreign money. Federal law prohibits \u201cforeign nationals\u201d \u2014 a legal term encompassing foreign individuals, corporations and governments \u2014 from putting money into the U.S. political process. But federal law also states that any company legally incorporated in the U.S., no matter its ultimate ownership, is a U.S. national.\nThis was not a significant concern prior to the Citizens United decision, because corporations had been largely barred from spending money on federal elections. By lifting that ban on corporate political donations, Citizens United changed the equation and made it possible for a corporation that is 100 percent owned by foreigners to participate in U.S. politics.\nBarack Obama warned in his State of the Union address immediately after the Citizens United ruling that foreign-owned corporations would now be able to \u201cspend without limit in our elections.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito, part of the Citizens United majority, was in the audience and shook his head at Obama\u2019s claim, mouthing \u201cnot true.\u201d\nThe Intercept obtained a memo from Charles Spies, one of the Republican Party\u2019s top campaign finance lawyers, written for a client and showing exactly how to do it.\nWeintraub is asking the FEC to direct its counsel to begin the process of creating new regulations to close the Citizens United loophole and prevent corporations with significant foreign ownership from participating in U.S. elections.\n\u201cOur courts have said that foreign money may be barred from our elections,\u201d Weintraub writes in her conclusion. \u201cCongress has said that foreign money must be barred from our elections. The American public has the right to expect the Federal Election Commission to ensure that foreign money is barred from our elections.\u201d\nRavel\u2019s proposal, also on the agenda for this Thursday\u2019s FEC meeting, would not go as far as Weintraub\u2019s. Rather than calling for the commission to create entirely new regulations, Ravel is asking the commission to rescind previous advisory opinions that outlined how foreign-owned corporations could legally spend small amounts of their own money to set up a company-sponored political action committee that would then receive donations from U.S. citizens. Spies relied on those opinions in his memo to create an avenue for foreign-owned corporations to make unlimited donations to Super PACs from their own treasuries.\nThere is cause for skepticism that the FEC will take action on either proposal. The commission has six members and by law no more than three can be from the same political party. In the past this had led to frequent 3-3 deadlocks, with the Republican commissioners consistently voting against investigations or new regulation of campaign donations. Weintraub and Ravel are the commission\u2019s two Democrats; Steven T. Walther, an independent, often votes with them.",

    "title": "Long-Secret Stingray Manuals Detail How Police Can Spy on Phones",
    "content": "Harris Corp.\u2019s Stingray surveillance device has been one of the most closely guarded secrets in law enforcement for more than 15 years. The company and its police clients across the United States have fought to keep information about the mobile phone-monitoring boxes from the public against which they are used. The Intercept has obtained several Harris instruction manuals spanning roughly 200 pages and meticulously detailing how to create a cellular surveillance dragnet.\nHarris has fought to keep its surveillance equipment, which carries price tags in the low six figures, hidden from both privacy activists and the general public, arguing that information about the gear could help criminals. Accordingly, an older Stingray manual released under the Freedom of Information Act to news website TheBlot.com last year was almost completely redacted. So too have law enforcement agencies at every level, across the country, evaded almost all attempts to learn how and why these extremely powerful tools are being used \u2014 though court battles have made it clear Stingrays are often deployed without any warrant. The San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s Department alone has snooped via Stingray, sans warrant, over 300 times.\nRichard Tynan, a technologist with Privacy International, told The Intercept that the \u201cmanuals released today offer the most up-to-date view on the operation of\u201d Stingrays and similar cellular surveillance devices, with powerful capabilities that threaten civil liberties, communications infrastructure, and potentially national security. He noted that the documents show the \u201cStingray II\u201d device can impersonate four cellular communications towers at once, monitoring up to four cellular provider networks simultaneously, and with an add-on can operate on so-called 2G, 3G, and 4G networks simultaneously.\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t any place for innocent people to hide from a device such as this,\u201d Tynan wrote in an email.\n\u201cAs more of our infrastructure, homes, environment, and transportation are connected wirelessly to the internet, such technologies really do pose a massive risk to public safety and security.\u201d\nAnd the Harris software isn\u2019t just extremely powerful, Tynan added, but relatively simple, providing any law enforcement agent with a modicum of computer literacy the ability to spy on large groups of people:\nThe ease with which the StingRay II can be used is quite striking and there do not seem to be any technical safeguards against misuse. \u2026 It also allows the operator to configure virtually every aspect of the operation of the fake cell tower. \u2026 The Gemini platform also allows for the logging and analysis of data to and from the network and \u201cOnce a message to/from any active subscriber in the Subscriber list is detected, Gemini will notify the user.\u201d How many innocent communications of the public are analyzed during this process?\nTynan also raised questions about the extent to which Stingrays may be disrupting the communications infrastructure, including existing cellular towers.\nHarris declined to comment. In a 2014 letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the company argued that if the owner\u2019s manuals were released under the Freedom of Information Act, this would \u201charm Harris\u2019s competitive interests\u201d and \u201ccriminals and terrorist[s] would have access to information that would allow them to build countermeasures.\u201d But Stingrays are known for spying on low-level marijuana dealers and other domestic targets, not al Qaeda; as the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s Jennifer Lynch said in December, \u201cI am not aware of any case in which a police agency has used a cell-site simulator to find a terrorist.\u201d Meanwhile, it is already publicly known that the NSA uses Stingray-like devices to locate suspected terrorists as part of a system known as Gilgamesh. Nathan Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept that \u201cwhen the most likely \u2018countermeasure\u2019 is someone turning their phone off or leaving it at home, it is hard to understand how public release of a manual like this could cause harm.\u201d And furthermore, said Wessler, \u201cIt is in the public interest to understand the general capabilities of this technology, so that lawmakers and judges can exercise appropriate oversight and protect people\u2019s privacy rights.\u201d\nThe documents described and linked below, instruction manuals for the software used by Stingray operators, were provided to The Intercept as part of a larger cache believed to have originated with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Two of them contain a \u201cdistribution warning\u201d saying they contain \u201cProprietary Information and the release of this document and the information contained herein is prohibited to the fullest extent allowable by law.\u201d\nAlthough \u201cStingray\u201d has become a catch-all name for devices of its kind, often referred to as \u201cIMSI catchers,\u201d the manuals include instructions for a range of other Harris surveillance boxes, including the Hailstorm, ArrowHead, AmberJack, and KingFish. They make clear the capability of those devices and the Stingray II to spy on cellphones by, at minimum, tracking their connection to the simulated tower, information about their location, and certain \u201cover the air\u201d electronic messages sent to and from them. Wessler added that parts of the manuals make specific reference to permanently storing this data, something that American law enforcement has denied doing in the past.\nOne piece of Windows software used to control Harris\u2019s spy boxes, software that appears to be sold under the name \u201cGemini,\u201d allows police to track phones across 2G, 3G, and LTE networks. Another Harris app, \u201ciDen Controller,\u201d provides a litany of fine-grained options for tracking phones. A law enforcement agent using these pieces of software along with Harris hardware could not only track a large number of phones as they moved throughout a city but could also apply nicknames to certain phones to keep track of them in the future. The manual describing how to operate iDEN, the lengthiest document of the four at 156 pages, uses an example of a target (called a \u201csubscriber\u201d) tagged alternately as Green Boy and Green Ben:\nThe documents also make clear just how easy it is to execute a bulk surveillance regime from the trunk of a car: A Gemini \u201cQuick Start Guide,\u201d which runs to 54 pages, contains an entire chapter on logging, which \u201cenables the user to listen and log over the air messages that are being transmitted between the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Mobile Subscriber (MS).\u201d It\u2019s not clear exactly what sort of metadata or content would be captured in such logging. The \u201cuser\u201d here, of course, is a police officer.\nIn order to maintain an uninterrupted connection to a target\u2019s phone, the Harris software also offers the option of intentionally degrading (or \u201credirecting\u201d) someone\u2019s phone onto an inferior network, for example, knocking a connection from LTE to 2G:\nA video of the Gemini software installed on a personal computer, obtained by The Intercept and embedded below, provides not only an extensive demonstration of the app but also underlines how accessible the mass surveillance code can be: Installing a complete warrantless surveillance suite is no more complicated than installing Skype. Indeed, software such as Photoshop or Microsoft Office, which require a registration key or some other proof of ownership, are more strictly controlled by their makers than software designed for cellular interception.\n\u201cWhile this device is being discussed in the context of U.S. law enforcement,\u201d said Tynan, \u201cthis could be used by foreign agents against the U.S. public and administration. It is no longer acceptable for our phones and mobile networks to be exploited in such an invasive and indiscriminate way.\u201d\nDocuments published with this article:",

    "title": "Facebook Is Collaborating With the Israeli Government to Determine What Should Be Censored",
    "content": "Last week, a major censorship controversy erupted when Facebook began deleting all posts containing the iconic photograph of the Vietnamese \u201cNapalm Girl\u201d on the ground that it violated the company\u2019s ban on \u201cchild nudity.\u201d Facebook even deleted a post from the prime minister of Norway, who posted the photograph in protest of the censorship. As outrage spread, Facebook ultimately reversed itself \u2014 acknowledging \u201cthe history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time\u201d \u2014 but this episode illustrated many of the dangers I\u2019ve previously highlighted in having private tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google become the arbiters of what we can and cannot see.\nHaving just resolved that censorship effort, Facebook seems to be vigorously courting another. The Associated Press reports today from Jerusalem that \u201cthe Israeli government and Facebook have agreed to work together to determine how to tackle incitement on the social media network.\u201d These meetings are taking place \u201cas the government pushes ahead with legislative steps meant to force social networks to rein in content that Israel says incites violence.\u201d In other words, Israel is about to legislatively force Facebook to censor content deemed by Israeli officials to be improper, and Facebook appears eager to appease those threats by working directly with the Israeli government to determine what content should be censored.\nThe joint Facebook-Israel censorship efforts, needless to say, will be directed at Arabs, Muslims, and Palestinians who oppose Israeli occupation. The AP article makes that clear: \u201cIsrael has argued that a wave of violence with the Palestinians over the past year has been fueled by incitement, much of it spread on social media sites.\u201d As Alex Kane reported in The Intercept in June, Israel has begun actively surveilling Palestinians for the content of their Facebook posts and even arresting some for clear political speech. Israel\u2019s obsession with controlling Palestinians\u2019 use of social media is motivated by the way it has enabled political organizing by occupation opponents; as Kane wrote: \u201cA demonstration against the Israeli occupation can be organized in a matter of hours, while the monitoring of Palestinians is made easier by the large digital footprint they leave on their laptops and mobile phones.\u201d\nNotably, Israel was represented in this meeting with Facebook by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, an extremist by all measures who has previously said she does not believe in a Palestinian state. Shaked has \u201cproposed legislation that seeks to force social networks to remove content that Israel considers to be incitement,\u201d and recently boasted that Facebook is already extremely compliant with Israeli censorship demands: \u201cOver the past four months Israel submitted 158 requests to Facebook to remove inciting content,\u201d she said, and Facebook has accepted those requests in 95 percent of the cases.\nAll of this underscores the severe dangers of having our public discourse overtaken, regulated, and controlled by a tiny number of unaccountable tech giants. I suppose some people are comforted by the idea that benevolent Facebook executives like Mark Zuckerberg are going to protect us all from \u201chate speech\u201d and \u201cincitement,\u201d but \u2014 like \u201cterrorism\u201d \u2014 neither of those terms have any fixed meanings, are entirely malleable, and are highly subject to manipulation for propagandistic ends. Do you trust Facebook \u2014 or the Israeli government \u2014 to assess when a Palestinian\u2019s post against Israeli occupation and aggression passes over into censorship-worthy \u201chate speech\u201d or \u201cincitement\u201d?\nWhile the focus here is on Palestinians\u2019 \u201cincitement,\u201d it\u2019s actually very common for Israelis to use Facebook to urge violence against Palestinians, including settlers urging \u201cvengeance\u201d when there is an attack on an Israeli. Indeed, as the Washington Post recently noted, \u201cPalestinians have also taken issue with social-media platforms, saying they incite violence and foster an Israeli discourse of hatred, racism and discriminatory attitudes against Palestinians.\u201d\nIn 2014, thousands of Israelis used Facebook to post messages \u201ccalling for the murder of Palestinians.\u201d When an IDF occupying soldier was arrested for shooting and killing a wounded Palestinian point blank in the head last year, IDF soldiers used Facebook to praise the killing and justify that violence, with online Israeli mobs gathering in support. Indeed, Justice Minister Shaked herself \u2014 now part of the government team helping Facebook determine what to censor \u2014 has used Facebook to post astonishingly extremist and violence-inducing rhetoric against Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his other top ministers have done the same. As Al Jazeera America detailed in 2014:\nThe hate speech against Arabs that gathered momentum on Facebook and Twitter soon spilled out onto the streets of Jerusalem as extremist Israelis kicked up violence and caused chaos. This violence then made its way back online: YouTube and Facebook videos show hundreds of angry Israeli mobs running around chanting, \u201cDeath to Arabs,\u201d and looking for Palestinians to attack. A video of an Israeli Jew attacking a Palestinian on a public bus shouting, \u201cFilthy Arabs, filthy Arab murderers of children,\u201d emerged from Tel Aviv. And more video footage showing Israeli security forces using excessive force on a handcuffed Palestinian-American boy further called into question who was really inciting this chaos.\nCan anyone imagine Facebook deleting the posts of prominent Israelis calling for increased violence or oppression against Palestinians? Indeed, is it even possible to imagine Facebook deleting the posts of Americans or western Europeans who call for aggressive wars or other forms of violence against predominantly Muslim countries, or against critics of the West? To ask the question is to answer it. Facebook is a private company, with a legal obligation to maximize profit, and so it will interpret very slippery concepts such as \u201chate speech\u201d and \u201cinciting violence\u201d to please those who wield the greatest power. It\u2019s thus inconceivable that Facebook would ever dream of deleting this type of actual advocacy or incitement of violence:\nFacebook is confronting extreme pressure to censor content disliked by various governments. The U.S. and U.K. have jointly launched a campaign to malign Silicon Valley companies as terrorist helpers or ISIS supporters for refusing to take more active steps to ban content from those whom these governments regard as \u201cterrorists.\u201d Israel has been particularly aggressive in attempting to blame Facebook for violence and coerce it to censor. Family members of Israelis killed by Palestinians are suing Facebook claiming the company helped facilitate those attacks, while some Israelis have actually complained that Facebook is biased against Israel in its censorship practices.\nAbout all of this, The Intercept submitted the following questions to Facebook, which has not yet responded; we will update this article if it does:\n1) Has FB ever met with Palestinian leaders in an effort to identify and suppress posts from Israelis that incite violence? Is there any plan to do so?\n2) If an Israeli advocates that Palestinians be attacked and/or bombed, would those posts violate FB\u2019s terms of service and be deleted? Have any ever been?\n3) What role, exactly, is the Israeli government playing in helping FB identify content that should be barred?\n4) FB said it \u201cgranted some 95% of the requests\u201d from Israeli officials to remove content. What percentage of requests from Palestinians to remove content has been accepted?\n5) If someone says that Israel\u2019s occupation is illegal and should be resisted using all means, would that be permitted?\nIt\u2019s true that these companies have the legal right as private actors to censor whatever they want. But that proposition ignores the unprecedented control this small group of corporations now exerts over global communications. That this censorship is within their legal rights does not obviate the serious danger this corporate conduct poses, for reasons I set forth here in describing how vast their influence has become in shaping our discourse (see here for a disturbing story today on how Twitter banned a Scottish pro-independence group after it criticized an article from a tabloid journalist, who then complained she was being \u201charassed\u201d).\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Facebook, at this point, is far and away the most dominant force in journalism. It is indescribably significant to see it work with a government to censor the speech of that government\u2019s opponents. But as is so often the case with censorship, people are content with its application until it is used to suppress views they agree with or like.\nOne of the early promises of the internet, a key potential benefit, was its ability to equalize disparities, to enable the powerless to communicate as freely and potently as the powerful, and to politically organize in far more efficient ways. Those who continually call on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to censor content are seriously jeopardizing those values, no matter how noble their motives might be. It is difficult to imagine any scenario more at odds with the internet\u2019s promise than Facebook executives and the Israeli government meeting to decide what Palestinians will and will not be allowed to say.",

    "content": "The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will meet this Thursday to discuss former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who in 2013 gave journalists a massive cache of classified documents detailing the U.S. global surveillance regime.\nThe intelligence oversight panel will be discussing a report prepared by members and staff concerning Snowden\u2019s unauthorized disclosures, according to Jack Langer, director of communications for Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.,\nThe report is the product of \u201caround two years\u201d of work, he told The Intercept. While Langer noted that the report is classified, he said the committee might publish an unclassified executive summary \u2014 though there aren\u2019t any specific plans yet for its release, or to hold public hearings about its contents.\nWhen asked whether the timing of report had anything to do with talk of Snowden\u2019s return to the United States \u2014 to be pardoned or to face trial \u2014 Langer said the two events were unrelated.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and prominent activists are launching a campaign Wednesday to urge President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden. The announcement is expected to take place at an event in New York, where Snowden will speak via live stream from Moscow.\nHowever, the congressional meeting also closely coincides with another Snowden related event \u2014 the public debut of Oliver Stone\u2019s Snowden film. Langer did not respond to a request for comment on whether the committee would be discussing the movie, which is scheduled for release September 16.\nIn 2014, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, alleged that Russian intelligence might have helped Snowden to both escape U.S. prosecution and disclose the trove of documents. He offered no evidence to back up these claims, however.\nSnowden has from the start maintained he had no intention to stay in Russia, and did not bring any of the leaked materials with him there. It\u2019s unclear if the committee will include possible connections to Russia in its investigation.",

    "title": "Donald Trump, After Blasting Iraq War, Picks Top Iraq Hawk as Security Adviser",
    "content": "Donald Trump named former CIA director and extremist neoconservative James Woolsey his senior adviser on national security issues on Monday. Woolsey, who left the CIA in 1995, went on to become one of Washington\u2019s most outspoken promoters of U.S. war in Iraq and the Middle East.\nAs such, Woolsey\u2019s selection either clashes with Trump\u2019s noninterventionist rhetoric \u2014 or represents a pivot towards a more muscular, neoconservative approach to resolving international conflicts.\nTrump has called the Iraq War \u201ca disaster.\u201d\nWoolsey, by contrast, was a key member of the Project for the New American Century \u2014 a neoconservative think tank largely founded to encourage a second war with Iraq. Woolsey signed a letter in 1998 calling on Clinton to depose Saddam Hussein and only hours after the 9/11 attacks appeared on CNN and blamed the attacks on Iraq. Woolsey has continued to insist on such a connection despite the complete lack of evidence to support his argument. He also blames Iran.\nWeeks before the invasion of Iraq, Woolsey called for broader war in the Middle East, saying \u201cWorld War IV\u201d was already underway.\nWoolsey has also put himself in a position to profit from the wars he has promoted. He has served as vice president of Pentagon contracting giant Booz Allen, and as chairman of Paladin Capital Group, a private equity fund that invests in national security and cybersecurity.\nHe chairs the leadership council at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish national security nonprofit, and is a venture partner with Lux Capital Management, which invests in emerging technologies like drones, satellite imaging, and artificial intelligence.\nWoolsey went on CNN on Monday and said that he was principally motivated to support Trump because of his plans to expand U.S. military spending.\nTrump gave a speech last week in which he proposed dramatic expansions of the Army and Marines, and hundred-billion-dollar weapons systems for the Navy and Air Force. He offered no justification \u2014 aside from citing a few officials who claimed they wanted more firepower.\nWoolsey stood by Trump\u2019s proposal on Monday.\n\u201cI think the problem is her budget,\u201d Woolsey said of Trump\u2019s opponent, Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe is spending so much money on domestic programs \u2014 including ones that we don\u2019t even have now, and the ones we have now are underfunded \u2014 I think there can be very little room for the improvements in defense and intelligence that have to be made.\u201d\nWoolsey has previously called for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to be \u201changed by the neck until he\u2019s dead, rather than merely electrocuted.\u201d\nIn the past, Woolsey has publicly disagreed with Trump on a number of national security issues \u2014 including Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslim immigration. On Monday, Woolsey told CNN that such a plan would raise First Amendment issues, but that he supported a temporary immigration block from certain Muslim countries.\nThus far, at least, most prominent war hawks have found they had more in common with Clinton than Trump. \u201cI would say all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump,\u201d leading neoconservative Robert Kagan told a group in July.",

    "content": "I do not like prison. No one should.\nIt is a strenuous, unceasing effort to cope with the ordeal of being incarcerated at a federal prison. I find myself identifying with the title character from Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cRichard II\u201d when he laments his own effort to adjust to confinement by wondering, \u201cI have been studying how I may compare this prison where I live unto the world.\u201d I do my best to resist the thought that prison is a reflection of our society, but the comparisons are unavoidable. Unlike \u201cRichard II,\u201d my \u201cstudying\u201d has not been so much a comparison as an unhappy realization.\nFrom the moment I crossed the threshold from freedom to incarceration because I was charged with, and a jury convicted me of, leaking classified information to a New York Times reporter, I needed no reminder that I was no longer an individual. Prison, with its \u201cone size fits all\u201d structure, is not set up to recognize a person\u2019s worth; the emphasis is removal and categorization. Inmates are not people; we are our offenses. In this particular prison where I live, there are S-Os (sex offenders), Cho-Mos (child molesters), and gun and drug offenders, among others. Considering the charges and conviction that brought me here, I\u2019m not exactly sure to which category I belong. No matter. There is an overriding category to which I do belong, and it is this prison reality that I sadly \u201ccompare unto the world\u201d: I\u2019m not just an inmate, I\u2019m a black inmate.\nThinking that you know about something and actually experiencing it are completely different. Previously, my window into prison life was informed, in part, by the same depictions in movies, TV shows, and books that the rest of America has seen. And unfortunately, as a child I heard firsthand so many stories about prison life from people I knew that it seemed commonplace. I expected there to be a separation of the races \u2014 by some accounts \u201cnecessary\u201d racial segregation \u2014 because that is what I saw, read, and heard. My expectations and naivet\u00e9 could not prepare me for actually living in it, however.\nI didn\u2019t have to be taught the rules of prison society, particularly in regard to racial segregation, because they are so ingrained in just about every aspect of prison society that they seem instinctual. Even though there is no official mandate, here, I am my skin color. Whenever, in my stubborn idealism, I refuse to acknowledge being racially categorized and question the submission to it, the other prisoners invariably respond, \u201cMan, this is prison.\u201d\nThese distinctions are maintained even when I\u2019m watching TV, because there is no integrated TV watching in prison. I am not welcome to watch in the \u201cwhite,\u201d \u201cHispanic,\u201d or \u201cNative\u201d TV rooms. So I spend a lot of time in the black TV room. There are no spatial advantages or disadvantages to this segregation, because all the rooms have one or two tables, one or two TVs that offer the same channels, and the occasional pigeon flitting about indoors.\nFor me, the black TV room is a place of solace for reading, writing, being frustrated by Sudoku, and generally escaping from the everyday pain of prison life. However, even as an escape, its very existence constantly reminds me of the pervasiveness, pointlessness, and harmfulness of separation along racial lines. It is a reflection of America outside these walls. What I see in prison is sad, but what I\u2019m seeing from prison is worse.\nSince arriving here last June, and from the black TV room, I have seen news reports on the racially motivated shooting of black parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, and seemingly unending and routine instances of black citizens, including Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana, falling victim to excessive force and being killed by law enforcement officers. I have also seen reports of law enforcement officers being killed in attacks no less horrific. The sadness I feel at what has been happening outside these walls was already festering inside me before I became an inmate; when I entered prison, I was still reeling from the death of Michael Brown in the St. Louis area, which I proudly call home.\nWatching these tragedies from prison, and especially from the black TV room, has been a profound experience. Throughout the days when the shootings were being covered and commentary on the news channels was ongoing, both TVs in the black TV room were constantly tuned in. As the events were unfolding on the news, I was struck by the uncommon silence in the TV room. Accentuating the uneasy silence was an air of frustration and a palpable lack of surprise and shock not only from the others, but also from myself. I, for one, did not know what to say. And that silence was impacted by another burning question I had no answer for, especially being in prison: What am I, or anyone else here, to do? A possible answer came in the form of a comment from one of my fellow viewers that was as stark in breaking the silence as it was in defining where I was and what I was seeing. \u201cMan, this is America,\u201d he said.\nI cannot and will not accept that viewpoint, so I wanted and needed to know that outside the black TV room and outside the prison walls, the rest of America also found it unacceptable. I ventured out to see how the news was playing out in the other TV rooms. With the pretext of going to the ice machine (funny how we can\u2019t watch TV together, but we can use the same ice machine), I passed by the white TV room. Those TVs were not tuned to the news reports of the shootings. Instead, one was playing ESPN, the other COPS. I didn\u2019t make it into the Hispanic or Native TV rooms, but it became clear that the America of the white TV room, at least, was not the same as the one that was playing out in the black TV room, both on and off the screen.\nComparing prison unto the world has been no more complex than comparing one TV room to another. The black TV room and the prison society that allows and perpetuates it have not been providing me with a window to America \u2014 they have provided a lamentable mirror. That mirror is reflecting the reality that racial segregation, particularly tacitly, is all too American. The America one sees and experiences depends on what TV room the color of one\u2019s skin mandates.\nIn prison, I see that mindset of latent and allowable racism creating and being typified by racial segregation. On TV, I see that very same mindset in tragic action outside the prison walls through the use of racial profiling throughout the country, racially motivated voter ID laws, politicians stoking racial anxieties for votes, a criminal justice system that engages in racially disparate application and enforcement of the law, and much more. Such all-too-American, misguided practices foster, if not encourage, societal segregation and incite the dangers that necessarily accompany it. I can argue that the Charleston church shooter, the white law enforcement officers who have killed black citizens, and the black men who have killed law enforcement officers acted out of an animosity fueled by this same sort of prison mindset. What I have seen of the America I was a part of is the unfortunate and natural extension of what I\u2019m living in prison.\nCall me naive, call me a dreamer, and I\u2019ll wear those monikers proudly because I still believe, even from prison, in this country and what it is supposed to stand for. Has that been my personal experience and what I\u2019ve been seeing from prison? No. As merely one example, during my time in the CIA it became clear, in the organization\u2019s words and actions toward me, that they saw me not as an American who wanted to serve his country but as \u201ca big black guy.\u201d But my dreams of America are far more enduring than a prison TV room mentality. There is a black America, there is a white America, there are many Americas. The greatness and promise of this country lies in equality reinforced by our differences rather than defined by them. My America is not a prison. For now, I\u2019m confined to the black TV room at the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado. When I am free, I don\u2019t want to feel that I\u2019m merely going from one prison to another.",

    "title": "Clinton Aides Complain About Double Standard, But Media Also Went After Bush Foundation",
    "content": "Claiming victimhood after critical coverage of Saudi donations to the Clinton Foundation, Hillary Clinton campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon recently whined on Twitter that comparable Saudi links to a Bush family foundation didn\u2019t receive anything like the same level of media scrutiny.\nWhen I tried to correct him, he Tweeted a dare:\nPls count up the stories about the 'crisis' of Bush 43 serving while 41's Foundation remained operational, and then let's compare\n\u2014 Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) August 21, 2016\nClinton operatives and their media supporters have cast criticism of Clinton Foundation practices as indicative of a double standard and complained that allegations of unethical conduct unfairly tarnish an otherwise sterling charitable enterprise. The level of transparency the foundation has imposed on itself is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Clinton loyalists frequently insist.\nIt\u2019s true that the volume of criticism over the Clintons\u2019 close relationship with Saudi financiers has been substantial, including a recent front-page story in the New York Times. But this is not evidence of any anti-Clinton conspiracy \u2014 it\u2019s common sense. And the Bushes faced similar allegations.\nSo I decided to take Fallon up on his challenge. There are plenty of examples.\nIn a May 2002 column lambasting George W.\u2019s foreign policy acumen, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd mocked the elder Bush\u2019s acceptance of Saudi largesse: \u201cThe Bush presidential library was built in part with millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,\u201d she wrote.\nIn September 2003, the American Prospect, a leading liberal policy journal, cited \u201cthe Saudi bankrolling of Poppy\u2019s presidential library\u201d as evidence of a sinister linkage between \u201cthe House of Bush and the House of Saud,\u201d and intimated that the opaque connections between the two families undermined U.S. credibility on the world stage. The author, Michael Steinberger, recommended that Democrats exploit this vulnerability in the forthcoming 2004 presidential election. (John Kerry later heeded Steinberger\u2019s call.)\nThe liberal Center for American Progress think tank issued a report in 2004 entitled \u201cThe Complete Saudi Primer,\u201d which detailed all the multitudes of ways in which the Bushes\u2019 Saudi dealings \u2014 including then-Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Prince Bandar bin Sultan\u2019s $1 million donation to the Bush Library \u2014 were indicative of nefarious collusion. The founder and president of the organization at the time of the report\u2019s publication was John Podesta, the current chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.\nIn March 2002, the late journalist Robert Novak disclosed in the Chicago Sun-Times that Bill Clinton had journeyed to Saudi Arabia to deliver a speech for which he was compensated $750,000. Novak noted that the Saudis had also extended financial support to the Bush Family, by way of a donation to the senior George\u2019s library fund.\nA May 2003 cover story in The Atlantic by Robert Baer described the many ways in which Saudi Arabia had allegedly exerted undue influence on the Bush administration and noted: \u201cFor good measure [Bandar] also contributed a million dollars to the construction of the Bush Presidential Library, in College Station, Texas.\u201d\nThen there was the October 2003 feature in Vanity Fair, \u201cSaving the Saudis,\u201d by Craig Unger, which argued that the extensive personal and financial ties between the Bush clan and various Saudi tycoons likely influenced George W. to take preferential government action on behalf of his foreign benefactors \u2014 the most notorious example being when members of the royal family were permitted to board a private plane and flee the United States two days after 9/11, even as all other air traffic had been grounded. The Saudis had \u201ccontributed to every presidential library built in the past 30 years,\u201d Unger wrote.\nReporting from Unger\u2019s article (and book) served as source material for a major part of Michael Moore\u2019s 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, the highest-grossing documentary of all time.\nSo, Brian, are these examples satisfactory? Do you agree now that this is a legitimate concern \u2013 not simply an unmerited attack by mean-spirited journalists? And are you ready to address whether or not the Clintons are unduly beholden to the Saudis?\nThat\u2019s not a rhetorical question. For instance, irrespective of any explicit quid pro quo, the Saudis have won tacit acquiescence from Clinton for their military campaign in Yemen, which has caused what is arguably the worst current humanitarian crisis in the world. Using U.S.-provided weaponry, Saudi forces have bombed schools, factories, and hospitals, killing scores of civilians including many children. Vast swaths of the population are now deprived of basic living amenities. Critical infrastructure has been destroyed, preventing the transport of needed goods.\nBut even though the conflict has been raging since March 2015, Clinton has offered no critical words in public. At a campaign event on June 1, I asked directly for her view on the Saudi incursion \u2014 twice. She ignored the question. To this day, her website contains no discussion of the ongoing bombardment. The topic did not come up during last week\u2019s \u201cCommander-in-Chief Forum\u201d on NBC.\nBy contrast, Donald Trump in August appeared to criticize U.S. involvement with the Saudis in Yemen, although his comments were garbled and only semi-coherent.",

    "title": "More Proof the U.S. National Anthem Has Always Been Tainted With Racism",
    "content": "The decision of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to sit during the pregame playing of the national anthem has had a larger impact than anyone could have foreseen.\nPresident Obama has weighed in, endorsing Kaepernick\u2019s \u201cconstitutional right to make a statement.\u201d When Kaepernick changed his protest to kneeling instead of sitting, teammate Eric Reid joined him. Brandon Marshall of the Denver Broncos followed suit and lost an endorsement deal. Marcus Peters of the Kansas City Chiefs raised a fist during the anthem, a la John Carlos and Tommy Smith at the 1968 Olympics. An unidentified Navy sailor who took a seat in solidarity with Kaepernick may face disciplinary action. The protest has even spread to high school players across the country.\nMuch of the debate generated by Kaepernick has been on subjects directly connected to his actions: police brutality, free speech, and the rights and obligations of professional athletes.\nBut it\u2019s also sparked nationwide discussion of something more tangential that no one saw coming \u2014 the meaning and history of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d itself, including whether it should be rewritten or replaced entirely.\nThe very fact this controversy was surprising may be the most significant thing about it. It\u2019s the clearest demonstration possible that even in 2016, the U.S. has barely begun dragging the unflattering aspects of its past out into the light. Part of that means facing the reality that everything about \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d \u2014 its lyrics, its author, and the path it took to becoming the national anthem \u2014 is inextricably bound up with America\u2019s gruesome history of racism.\nThe Meaning of \u201cThe Hireling and Slave\u201d\nIt took 117 years from the time \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d was written in 1814 until it was legally enshrined as the American national anthem in 1931.\nFrancis Scott Key wrote the poem that became the song\u2019s lyrics on Sept. 14, 1814, after witnessing the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore during the (poorly named) War of 1812. As The Intercept recently noted, Key\u2019s little-known third stanza includes these lines:\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\nFrom the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\nO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\nBy the time Key wrote these words, the British military included a regiment of former slaves called the Colonial Marines, whom the British had encouraged to escape and then trained and armed.\nIn fact, just weeks before, on Aug. 24, 1814, the Colonial Marines had participated in the Battle of Bladensburg outside Washington, D.C. The Bladensburg fight was a quick, embarrassing defeat for American troops \u2014 something Key knew because he\u2019d witnessed it up close as a volunteer aide to a U.S. general. The British forces, including the Colonial Marines, had then continued to Washington the same day, infamously occupying and torching the White House.\nThe Intercept stated that \u201cslave\u201d referred to these Colonial Marines. However, an enormous number of readers argued that this identification was incorrect, and that Key did not literally mean escaped slaves.\nMany such commenters cited an obscure website that describes itself as \u201chistory for kids\u201d and states that \u201cslave\u201d refers to U.S. sailors who had been seized and press-ganged into the British navy. (The impressment of Americans was a central grievance cited by the U.S in the lead-up to war.) Others suggested that small-r republican rhetoric from the era often referred to any subjects of a monarch as slaves, and hence the word simply signified all the British.\nKey himself never explained precisely what he meant by the third stanza. According to Marc Leepson, author of a recent biography of Key, Key spoke about \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d in public just once and did not mention this issue. Key did not write about the song in his surviving letters.\nThat said, Leepson explains, while researching his book he \u201cdid not find any historians who interpreted the \u2018hireling and slave\u2019 line as anything but a reference to the enslaved people who escaped their bonds and went over to the British side.\u201d Leepson himself also believes it is \u201cclear\u201d this is the correct way to interpret the stanza.\nAmong the academic experts with this perspective is Alan Taylor, a University of Virginia professor and one of the foremost contemporary scholars of early U.S. history. Two of Taylor\u2019s books have won the Pulitzer Prize; one of these, \u201cThe Internal Enemy,\u201d addresses the song\u2019s third stanza, calling it \u201cKey\u2019s dig at the British for employing Colonial Marines.\u201d\nIn response to questions, Taylor pointed out that it \u201cmakes no sense\u201d to believe that Key was referring to impressed U.S. sailors: \u201cAmerican rhetoric of the time cast the impressed sailors as defiant and unbroken by British might \u2014 as the exact opposite of the slave.\u201d Moreover, Key certainly would not be celebrating the deaths of Americans held by the British.\nOther academic historians with this view include Gene Allen Smith, a specialist in early American and American naval history and author of \u201cThe Slaves\u2019 Gamble: Choosing Sides in the War of 1812\u201d; David Reedier; Marc Wayne Kruman; and John Belohlavek. Even Marc Clague, a musicologist and co-founder of the Star Spangled Music Foundation, who strongly defends the song overall, agrees that by \u201cslave\u201d Key meant the Colonial Marines.\nBy the mid-1800s, the phrase \u201chireling and slave\u201d could be found in the writing of slavery\u2019s supporters to differentiate between wage laborers and those in actual bondage. Whether this usage was adopted from \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or the other way around is unclear, but William Grayson, a U.S. representative from South Carolina, even titled a famed 1855 pro-slavery poem \u201cThe Hireling and the Slave.\u201d Grayson contended that slavery had been a \u201cblessing\u201d for Africans and was morally superior to a system of wage work. Grayson also described whites using a new term he had coined: a \u201cmaster race.\u201d\n\u201cI Bought an Old Woman and a Little Girl\u201d\nFrancis Scott Key could be called the most unknown famous person in U.S. history. A look at his rarely examined life makes clear how difficult it is to separate the national anthem\u2019s meaning from its author, and his gross hypocrisy on the meaning of freedom.\nKey was born in 1779 on his wealthy family\u2019s Maryland plantation, known as Terra Rubra. After childhood he left to study law and eventually moved to Washington, D.C., where he kept one or two slaves as servants. In 1813, the year before the British attack on Fort McHenry, Key wrote to his father to inform him that he had just purchased \u201can old woman and a little girl about 12 or 18 years old.\u201d Key offered to send them to his parents to work on their plantation and apparently did so; in a subsequent letter he asked his mother \u201chow you like the old woman and the girl.\u201d\nUpon his father\u2019s death, Key inherited Terra Rubra and its coerced workforce. Key was not physically cruel as a master and during his lifetime freed seven of his household\u2019s slaves. (One, Clem Johnson, had been the plantation\u2019s assistant estate manager. Johnson subsequently stayed at Terra Rubra to help oversee Key\u2019s property, both land and humans.)\nMoreover, as Key\u2019s biographer Leepson explains, Key \u201cstrongly opposed international slave trafficking on humanitarian grounds, and defended enslaved people and free blacks without charge in the D.C. courts. If you cherry-picked his words on slavery, you might think he was an abolitionist.\u201d\nThat, however, would be almost 180 degrees from the truth.\nIn his work, Key was the prototypical Washington lobbyist. In the 1820s, he parlayed his celebrity as patriotic poet into a lucrative law practice helping clients with business before the federal government. During this period, Key also represented slaveholders attempting to retrieve their escaped \u201cproperty.\u201d In time, Key became a confidant to President Andrew Jackson. He was, in today\u2019s parlance, a Washington insider.\nWhen Jackson appointed Key to serve as district attorney for Washington in 1833, it was not least to enforce the law controlling African-Americans, both those enslaved and the city\u2019s growing population of free blacks. During Key\u2019s seven years in office he proved an energetic and moralistic prosecutor, taking on the dangers of fornication and abolitionism with equal fervor.\nIn 1833, Key tried to shut down the capital\u2019s \u201cbawdy houses,\u201d the popular female-run brothels that served both white and black customers. (A glance at 20-plus pages of \u201cescort\u201d advertisements in today\u2019s D.C. Yellow Pages indicates that Key failed to stamp out sex work in Washington.) The same year, Key indicted John Prout, a free, black school teacher who had forged papers for a young enslaved couple attempting to escape to freedom. Prout was convicted and was forced to leave town.\nThe next year, Key ignored the First Amendment to persecute Ben Lundy, a courageous editor who published an anti-slavery newspaper in the capital. Lundy and his assistant editor, the young but soon-to-be famous William Lloyd Garrison, also had to flee Washington, lest they be assaulted by slavers.\nKey, like many U.S. politicians after him, was a stickler for \u201claw and order.\u201d Blacks who encountered the constables serving Key often ended up robbed or dead. When a white riot swept the city in August 1835, Key sought to quell fears of a slave rebellion by seeking the death penalty for Arthur Bowen, a young black man accused of attempted murder. When doubts arose about Bowen\u2019s guilt, District Attorney Key was implacable in seeking to hang him. (This perilous battle is recounted in more detail in the book \u201cSnow-Storm in August\u201d by this article\u2019s co-author.)\nKey next prosecuted a New York doctor who had moved to Washington with a trunk of anti-slavery literature. The trial attracted attention across the nation. In the courtroom, Key emotionally denounced the abolitionists who wanted to free all enslaved people.\nThey \u201cdeclare that every law which sanctions slavery is null and void, and that obedience to it is a sin,\u201d Key declaimed. \u201cThat we have no more rights over our slaves than they have over us. Does not this bring the Constitution and the laws under which we live into contempt? Is it not a plain invitation to resist them?\u201d\nThe American Anti-Slavery Society responded by mocking Key\u2019s most famous words. In an 1836 broadsheet distributed nationwide, the abolitionists detailed the atrocities of human trafficking in the U.S. capital under the headline \u201cLand of the Free/Home of the Oppressed.\u201d If Twitter had existed in the 1830s, that likely would have become a trending hashtag: #HomeOfTheOppressed.\nSeen through the prism of Key\u2019s life, then, the significance of his words about the \u201cland of the free\u201d comes into focus. For Key, freedom was never a promise available to everyone; white freedom and white lives were what mattered.\n\u201cA Monstrous Perversion\u201d\nThe popularity of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d grew continuously in the decades after Key wrote the lyrics. By the time of the Civil War, some on both sides tried to claim it as their own.\nTellingly, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. felt that if the song were to belong to the North, it would need a new stanza \u2014 one he provided, invoking \u201cthe millions unchained who our birthright have gained.\u201d By contrast, supporters in the South did not believe it required any changes. \u201cLet us never surrender to the North the noble song, the \u2018Star-Spangled Banner,\u2019\u201d the Richmond Examiner editorialized in 1861 in the capital of the Confederacy. \u201cIt is Southern in origin, in sentiments, in poetry, and song. In its association with chivalrous deeds, it is ours.\u201d\nIn the subsequent decades, \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d continued to be contested territory and the subject of what we\u2019d now term a culture war. By the early 1900s, versions of the song that included Holmes\u2019s words were found in schoolbooks in New York, Indiana, Louisiana, and elsewhere.\nWhen Confederate veterans realized this, they quickly organized to force state governments, including that of New York, to withdraw the textbooks. The New York Times declared that Holmes\u2019s words were a \u201cmonstrous perversion\u201d and Holmes himself was a \u201cpresumptuous ass.\u201d (The extra stanza has since largely evaporated and is not part of the anthem\u2019s official lyrics.)\nThe skirmishing continued after the carnage of World War I, as momentum grew for the U.S. to adopt a formal national anthem. Pacifists denounced \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d as a war-mongering, anti-British jingle. A progressive heiress took out an anti-Banner ad in several newspapers, and several Columbia University professors announced a contest for a more suitable replacement.\nOn the other side, Maryland Rep. John Linthicum, the Daughters of the Confederacy, and other Southern civic organizations declared that the song was the essence of American patriotism.\nBy the 1920s, the battle lines were clear. Those who wanted to celebrate the post-Civil War unity of North and South without reference to the abolition of slavery favored \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Many Northerners preferred the emancipationist spirit of \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic,\u201d or the stately grandeur of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d African-Americans had their own ideas, and in 1926 adopted \u201cLift Every Voice\u201d by Florida poet James Weldon Johnson as a black national anthem.\nIn 1931 there was finally a clear winner: Congress approved, and President Herbert Hoover signed, Rep. Linthicum\u2019s bill making \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d America\u2019s one and only national anthem.\nControversy ensued within 48 hours. Partisans of the Banner held a parade in Linthicum\u2019s Baltimore district, led by two color guards: one hoisting the American flag, the other carrying the Confederate flag.\nThe Union Army veterans marching in the parade dropped out and denounced the damned rebels for hijacking the proceedings. In response, one neo-Confederate woman \u2014 in what sounds like an indignant Facebook post from this year \u2014 accused the offended Union veterans of being un-American and \u201cdivisive.\u201d\n\u201cHistory Could Be Swallowed Up So Completely\u201d\nThe suppression of history embodied by \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d is by no means unique to the U.S. On the contrary, it\u2019s universal: The most important and painful realities of any society\u2019s past tend to be forgotten unless constant efforts are made to remember them.\nIntriguingly, one of the most eloquent descriptions of this phenomenon is found in Barack Obama\u2019s autobiography, \u201cDreams From My Father.\u201d\nIn 1967, when Obama was 6, he and his mother joined his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, in Indonesia \u2014 just two years after one of the most astonishing bloodbaths of the 20th century had taken place there. Suharto, an Indonesian general, had seized power in 1965 and with U.S. support massacred at least 500,000 leftists and communists over just a few months.\nYet on the surface, Obama writes, there was little sign of this. His stepfather refused to speak of the past, and his mother learned of it only from \u201cinnuendo\u201d and \u201chalf-whispered asides\u201d from Americans when she went to work at the U.S. Embassy. According to Obama, this is the lesson she took from this:\nThe idea frightened her, the notion that history could be swallowed up so completely, the same way the rich and loamy earth could soak up the rivers of blood that had once coursed through the streets; the way people could continue about their business \u2026 as if nothing had happened. \u2026\nPower. The word fixed in my mother\u2019s mind like a curse. In America, it had generally remained hidden from view until you dug beneath the surface of things; until you visited an Indian reservation or spoke to a black person whose trust you had earned. But here power was undisguised, indiscriminate, naked. \u2026 And so Lolo had made his peace with power, learned the wisdom of forgetting.\nAmericans today are fortunate that the penalties for remembering our past, while real, are much less severe than in many other times and places. If we truly aspire to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, we should be able to examine the real history of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d \u2014 and most importantly, the degree to which that history is still alive today. Our current difficulty in facing our past honestly and soberly strongly suggests that we are still a long way from laying it to rest.",

    "title": "Alcohol Industry Bankrolls Fight Against Legal Pot in Battle of the Buzz",
    "content": "The fight against legalized pot is being heavily bankrolled by alcohol and pharmaceutical companies, terrified that they might lose market share.\nOn the heels of a filing last week that revealed that a synthetic cannabis company is financing the opposition to legal marijuana in Arizona comes a new disclosure this week that a beer industry group made one of the largest donations to an organization set up to defeat legalization in Massachusetts.\nThe Beer Distributors PAC, an affiliate that represents 16 beer-distribution companies in Massachusetts, gave $25,000 to the Campaign for a Safe and Healthy Massachusetts, tying it for third place among the largest contributors to the anti-pot organization.\nWilliam A. Kelley, the president of the Beer Distributors of Massachusetts, did not respond to a request for comment, but his organization\u2019s decision to oppose legalization is hardly unique in the alcohol industry.\nIn Arizona, one of the five states with marijuana legalization ballot measures this November, the Arizona Wine and Spirits Wholesale Association donated $10,000 to a group opposing legalization. In 2010, the last time California considered marijuana legalization, another alcoholic beverage distribution group provided financing to a law enforcement-backed campaign to defeat legalization.\nThe alcohol industry is nowhere near unified over pot policy, however, with several craft brewing firm welcoming laws that relax restrictions over pot.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission filings reveal that heavyweight alcohol companies have disclosed to investors that pot could pose a challenge to their bottom line.\nThe Boston Beer Company, the parent company of Sam Adams, told investors in its 10-K filing that laws that allow the \u201csale and distribution of marijuana\u201d could \u201cadversely impact the demand\u201d for beer.\nThe Brown-Forman Company, maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Finlandia Vodka, similarly warned in its 10-K filing that \u201cconsumer preferences and purchases may shift due to a host of factors, many of which are difficult to predict, including \u2026 the potential legalization of marijuana use on a more widespread basis within the United States, and changes in travel, leisure, dining, gifting, entertaining, and beverage consumption trends.\u201d\nResearch about the impact of marijuana legalization on consumer habits is split. Daniel Rees, a professor of economics at the University of Colorado, Denver, has claimed that consumers will substitute marijuana for alcohol when given the chance. But tax revenue in Colorado, which legalized pot in 2012, suggests consumers have continued to purchase alcohol at almost the same rate as before legalization.\nPaul Varga, the chief executive of Brown-Forman, told investors during an earnings call in August 2014 that marijuana legalization was emerging as a \u201cbig threat.\u201d But four months later, in another discussion with investors, Varga backpedaled a bit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m losing sleep over the legalization of marijuana,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying attention to it.\u201d",

Qual ser\u00e1 o papel desempenhado pelo Incra?\nO Instituto Nacional de Coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o e Reforma Agr\u00e1ria tem como fun\u00e7\u00e3o essencial redistribuir as terras do Brasil, acabando com grandes propriedades de terra improdutivas, dividir essas por\u00e7\u00f5es em lotes e entreg\u00e1-los para fam\u00edlias que dependem do campo e buscam condi\u00e7\u00f5es b\u00e1sicas para plantar.\nA ger\u00eancia pol\u00edtica dessa \u00e1rea do governo Temer foi entregue, ap\u00f3s uma negocia\u00e7\u00e3o sem contratempos, a Paulo Pereira da Silva, l\u00edder h\u00e1 22 anos ininterruptos da For\u00e7a Sindical, o segundo maior grupo de sindicatos do pa\u00eds e a principal apoiadora da ascens\u00e3o de Michel Temer ao poder entre representantes de trabalhadores. Paulinho foi uma das primeiras e principais vozes dentro da C\u00e2mara a favor do impeachment de Dilma Rousseff. \u00c9 ele quem d\u00e1 o aval para nomea\u00e7\u00f5es dentro do \u00f3rg\u00e3o \u2013 informalmente, claro, seguindo \u00e0 risca as regras t\u00e1citas da pol\u00edtica brasileira.\nAlgumas coisas chamam a aten\u00e7\u00e3o para a entrega do Incra para os des\u00edgnios de Paulinho da For\u00e7a, para al\u00e9m da demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o clara de que o fisiologismo continua imperando. A primeira \u00e9 que ele \u00e9 um sindicalista urbano. A segunda \u00e9 que, em seus tr\u00eas mandatos como deputado federal, Paulinho jamais apresentou um \u00fanico projeto relacionado ao assunto da reforma agr\u00e1ria. Ele tamb\u00e9m nunca integrou uma comiss\u00e3o da C\u00e2mara que discutisse projetos relativos ao tema, ou apresentou emendas parlamentares para, por exemplo, beneficiar assentamentos rurais.Apesar dessa dist\u00e2ncia do tema em sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o legislativa, um dos processos aos quais responde na Justi\u00e7a \u00e9 justamente por ilegalidades na\u2026 reforma agr\u00e1ria. Ele foi condenado em primeira inst\u00e2ncia pela Justi\u00e7a Federal por improbidade administrativa por participar, como presidente da For\u00e7a Sindical, de uma fraude de R$ 3 milh\u00f5es no Banco da Terra para a compra superavaliada de um terreno invi\u00e1vel para destina\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 reforma agr\u00e1ria.\n\u00c9 ele quem apadrinha o novo presidente do Incra, Leonardo G\u00f3es Silva, inclusive com not\u00edcia exaltando suas qualidades no site do Solidariedade, partido pol\u00edtico criado em 2013 por Paulinho. \u00c9 dele tamb\u00e9m a indica\u00e7\u00e3o de outros dirigentes, incluindo o respons\u00e1vel pelo desenvolvimento de novos projetos de assentamentos, Ewerton Giovanni dos Santos \u2014 este filiado ao Solidariedade em Minas Gerais e que advoga para ao menos um fazendeiro no Estado.\nMais que isso, Paulinho bancou a nomea\u00e7\u00e3o de seu filho para comandar uma das superintend\u00eancias regionais mais importantes do pa\u00eds, a de S\u00e3o Paulo. Alexandre Pereira da Silva \u00e9, desde o dia 4 de julho, o respons\u00e1vel por quest\u00f5es relativas, entre outras, \u00e0 luta pela terra na regi\u00e3o do Pontal do Paranapanema, pr\u00f3ximo \u00e0 divisa com o Mato Grosso do Sul, uma das mais conflituosas do pa\u00eds.\nO que, afinal, quer Paulinho \u00e0 frente do Incra? Recentemente, a Coluna Esplanada, do UOL, relatou que ele est\u00e1 criando um bra\u00e7o rural para a For\u00e7a Sindical, com o nome de For\u00e7a Rural, para ser um contrapeso para o MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem-Terra). Ainda n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada oficial a respeito, mas a For\u00e7a Sindical j\u00e1 tem um bra\u00e7o de atua\u00e7\u00e3o voltado especificamente para os trabalhadores rurais assalariados \u2014 ou seja, aqueles que trabalham no campo para agricultores. Nem CUT, maior central sindical do pa\u00eds, tem uma secretaria com esse perfil.\nApesar de o governo planejar um corte de metade da verba programada para a reforma agr\u00e1ria em 2017, o controle sobre o Incra tem um alto valor. Direcionar a sele\u00e7\u00e3o dos beneficiados com novos assentamentos, as verbas para melhorias da estrutura das terras cedidas para a reforma agr\u00e1ria e os mais de R$ 200 milh\u00f5es que o governo planeja para 2017, para a compra de novos terrenos, pode servir para garantir um bom capital pol\u00edtico a ele, \u00e0 sua central sindical e ao seu partido pol\u00edtico entre os hoje sem-terra.\nAliado do agroneg\u00f3cio controla desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o de terras\nA falta de um compromisso mais claro dos novos dirigentes do Incra com a causa da reforma agr\u00e1ria est\u00e1 presente, tamb\u00e9m, na nomea\u00e7\u00e3o de Luiz Ant\u00f4nio Possas de Carvalho para a Diretoria de Obten\u00e7\u00e3o de Terras e Implanta\u00e7\u00e3o de Projetos de Assentamentos \u2014 cargo que j\u00e1 tinha ocupado por apenas 45 dias no governo Dilma.\nPossas de Carvalho, avalizado por Paulinho, \u00e9 uma indica\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal do deputado federal Carlos Bezerra, do PMDB de Mato Grosso. Ele, que agora cuidar\u00e1 de interesses daqueles que querem tirar terras de grandes propriet\u00e1rios rurais, j\u00e1 advogou para importantes fazendeiros e pecuaristas \u2014 entre eles, em processo contra o Incra, numa desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o de terras da fam\u00edlia de Jonas Barcellos Corr\u00eaa Filho.\nJonas Barcellos \u00e9 conhecido como o \u201crei do gado\u201d brasileiro. \u00c9 um dos maiores criadores de boi nelore do pa\u00eds e conhecido por seu poder de lobby e alto tr\u00e2nsito entre autoridades da Rep\u00fablica. Uma de suas marcas \u00e9 a feijoada que oferece a poderosos em sua fazenda em Uberaba (MG). Est\u00e1 longe de ser um entusiasta da reforma agr\u00e1ria.\nEm levantamento feito pelo The Intercept Brasil, considerando somente os casos que tramitam ou tramitaram na Justi\u00e7a Federal de Mato Grosso, Possas de Carvalho surge como advogado em oito a\u00e7\u00f5es contra o Incra, em defesa de propriet\u00e1rios rurais ou grandes empresas agropecu\u00e1rias. Outro nome conhecido que j\u00e1 foi representado por ele em processo contra o \u00f3rg\u00e3o do qual agora \u00e9 diretor estrat\u00e9gico \u00e9 Fl\u00e1vio Pentagna Guimar\u00e3es, presidente do banco BMG.\nA gest\u00e3o do Incra est\u00e1 paralisada \u2026o TCU determinou a paralisa\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os processos de escolha de novos benefici\u00e1rios.\nPossas de Carvalho j\u00e1 tinha sido piv\u00f4 de uma opera\u00e7\u00e3o de barganha pol\u00edtica no apagar das luzes do governo de Dilma Rousseff. Ele foi nomeado por Dilma no fim de mar\u00e7o deste ano, para o mesmo cargo, com o objetivo de agradar o peemedebista Carlos Bezerra, do Mato Grosso, um dos estados com maior presen\u00e7a do agroneg\u00f3cio, onde 114 pessoas foram amea\u00e7adas de morte e seis delas foram assassinadas entre 2000 e 2010 em disputas por terras, segundo a Comiss\u00e3o Pastoral da Terra.\nNo entanto, com o voto de Carlos Bezerra a favor da admissibilidade do impeachment, Carvalho foi imediatamente exonerado pela ent\u00e3o presidente, recuperando o posto assim que Michel Temer assumiu o governo interino.\nA gest\u00e3o do Incra est\u00e1 paralisada, em grande parte, por for\u00e7a de decis\u00e3o tomada pelo Tribunal de Contas da Uni\u00e3o em abril deste ano. Foi encontrada uma gigantesca lista de absurdas irregularidades no \u00f3rg\u00e3o, especialmente na sele\u00e7\u00e3o de beneficiados para os assentamentos criados pelo instituto. Na decis\u00e3o, o TCU determinou a paralisa\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os processos de escolha de novos benefici\u00e1rios, assim como de qualquer apoio a assentamentos j\u00e1 existentes.\nH\u00e1 dinheiro para terras de grilheiro, mas falta para modernizar o Incra\nMesmo com a decis\u00e3o que, na pr\u00e1tica, congela a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de novos assentamentos, a \u00e1rea de obten\u00e7\u00e3o de terras seguiu funcionando a pleno vapor. Na sua primeira passagem pela diretoria de obten\u00e7\u00e3o de terras, Possas de Carvalho assumiu oficialmente no dia 28 de mar\u00e7o. De janeiro deste ano at\u00e9 aquele dia, o Incra tinha liberado R$ 2,2 milh\u00f5es para a desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o de tr\u00eas terrenos, conforme dados levantados pelo The Intercept Brasil no sistema Siga Brasil, de acompanhamento da execu\u00e7\u00e3o do Or\u00e7amento federal. Nos tr\u00eas dias que se seguiram \u00e0 posse de Carvalho, foram 16 libera\u00e7\u00f5es, num total de R$ 34 milh\u00f5es. At\u00e9 o momento em que foi exonerado por Dilma, ele j\u00e1 tinha carimbado R$ 76,4 milh\u00f5es para essas desapropria\u00e7\u00f5es. Depois, quando voltou sob Temer, foram mais R$ 16,8 milh\u00f5es para propriet\u00e1rios rurais at\u00e9 o fim de julho.\nN\u00e3o se tratam de novos decretos de desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o, mas do pagamento desses valores, que costumam rodar anos em a\u00e7\u00f5es judiciais de contesta\u00e7\u00f5es de valores. Entre essas libera\u00e7\u00f5es, a maior delas, no valor de R$ 24 milh\u00f5es, aconteceu no primeiro dia de sua gest\u00e3o. Foi para garantir a desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o da Fazenda Nacional, localizada no munic\u00edpio de \u00c1gua Boa, em Mato Grosso, seu estado. Outras tr\u00eas, num total de R$ 19 milh\u00f5es, beneficiaram Antonio Martins dos Santos, conhecido no meio rural como \u201cGalo Velho\u201d e apontado como o maior grileiro de terras de Rond\u00f4nia \u2014 onde est\u00e3o as fazendas pagas pelo Incra.\nAtualmente, Ant\u00f4nio Martins dos Santos \u00e9 um dos alvos de um inqu\u00e9rito sigiloso no STJ por suspeita de falsidade ideol\u00f3gica, falsifica\u00e7\u00e3o de documentos, corrup\u00e7\u00e3o ativa e associa\u00e7\u00e3o criminosa.\nO latifundi\u00e1rio \u00e9 ligado a Amir Lando, ex-senador que sempre teve ascend\u00eancia sobre a superintend\u00eancia do Incra em Rond\u00f4nia, que, por sua vez, \u00e9 aliado pol\u00edtico de Carlos Bezerra. Ambos fizeram dobradinha no in\u00edcio do governo Lula. Lando era o ministro da Previd\u00eancia Social, enquanto Bezerra presidia o INSS.\nEntre as novas autoriza\u00e7\u00f5es para desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o, em portaria publicada em agosto, o caso com maior valor envolve uma propriedade de uma fam\u00edlia de usineiros de Pernambuco. Ser\u00e1 comprada por R$ 21 milh\u00f5es, mas o dinheiro ainda n\u00e3o foi liberado.\nO governo quer fazer passar no Congresso um projeto de lei que autoriza a venda de grandes propriedades de terra para estrangeiro\nApesar dessa fartura de libera\u00e7\u00f5es de recursos para a compra de terras num contexto nebuloso, h\u00e1 outros detalhes da nova gest\u00e3o do Incra que chamam a aten\u00e7\u00e3o. O novo presidente do \u00f3rg\u00e3o, Leonardo G\u00f3es Silva, assinou duas resolu\u00e7\u00f5es, no \u00faltimo dia 29 de julho. Em uma delas, mandou cancelar, por falta de dinheiro, uma parceria com a UFRJ para \u201crealiza\u00e7\u00e3o de pesquisa voltada \u00e0 an\u00e1lise da trajet\u00f3ria de desenvolvimento dos assentamentos rurais e o modelo atual de atua\u00e7\u00e3o do Incra\u201d, com o objetivo de gerar \u201csubs\u00eddios para que o Incra planeje e organize a sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o futura no \u00e2mbito do Programa Nacional de Reforma Agr\u00e1ria\u201d. A parceria custaria ao Incra pouco mais de R$ 3 milh\u00f5es. Na outra, tamb\u00e9m alegando falta de verbas, suspendeu decis\u00e3o tomada em mar\u00e7o deste ano pela gest\u00e3o anterior, que havia aprovado as \u201cdiretrizes gerais, bem como as estimativas or\u00e7ament\u00e1rias do Projeto de Moderniza\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica do Incra\u201d.\nNo horizonte, h\u00e1 ainda mais um ponto que colocar\u00e1 o Incra no centro de uma pol\u00eamica. O governo quer fazer passar no Congresso um projeto de lei que autoriza a venda de grandes propriedades de terra para estrangeiros. O texto roda na C\u00e2mara desde 2007. Ganhou f\u00f4lego no ano passado e, j\u00e1 h\u00e1 alguns meses, est\u00e1 pronto para ser votado em plen\u00e1rio, e com apoio do presidente da C\u00e2mara, Rodrigo Maia. O texto n\u00e3o impede que terras ainda n\u00e3o declaradas para fins de reforma agr\u00e1ria pelo Incra sejam vendidas para estrangeiros. Um dono de uma vasta e improdutiva por\u00e7\u00e3o de terra pode achar mais neg\u00f3cio fechar um acordo com uma empresa de fora do que esperar a burocracia do governo para receber dinheiro de desapropria\u00e7\u00e3o.\nCaso o projeto seja aprovado dessa forma, ser\u00e1 uma boa forma de verificar o grau de republicanismo do Incra e seus dirigentes, j\u00e1 que uma maior lentid\u00e3o para produzir laudos e pegar terras para a reforma agr\u00e1ria pode levar as \u00e1reas improdutivas atuais a serem vendidas para interessados que h\u00e1 anos esperam a oportunidade de explorar o campo brasileiro.\nJ\u00c1 EST\u00c1 ACONTECENDO\nQuando o assunto \u00e9 a ascens\u00e3o da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa \u00e9 uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3 para anos eleitorais. Mas o projeto de poder bolsonarista nunca dorme.\nA grande m\u00eddia, o agro, as for\u00e7as armadas, as megaigrejas e as big techs bilion\u00e1rias ganharam for\u00e7a nas elei\u00e7\u00f5es municipais \u2014 e t\u00eam uma vantagem enorme para 2026.\nN\u00e3o podemos ficar alheios enquanto somos arrastados para o retrocesso, afogados em fuma\u00e7a t\u00f3xica e privados de direitos b\u00e1sicos. J\u00e1 passou da hora de agir. Juntos.\nA meta ousada do Intercept para 2025 \u00e9 nada menos que derrotar o golpe em andamento antes que ele conclua sua miss\u00e3o. Para isso, dependemos do apoio de nossos leitores.\nVoc\u00ea est\u00e1 pronto para combater a m\u00e1quina bilion\u00e1ria da extrema direita ao nosso lado? Fa\u00e7a uma doa\u00e7\u00e3o hoje mesmo.",
