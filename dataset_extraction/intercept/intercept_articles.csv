A população voltou às ruas neste domingo, dia 4, quatro dias depois de Michel Temer tomar posse em consequência ao impeachment de Dilma Rousseff. Em viagem à China, Temer menosprezou o tamanho das manifestações: “são 40, 50, 100 pessoas, nada mais do que isso”. Para os organizadores, eram 100 mil pessoas. É difícil dar uma conta exata de quantas foram para as ruas na capital de São Paulo para gritar “Fora, Temer”. Mas basta uma foto para constatar que Temer errou por umas dezenas de milhares:

Era só o começo. Primeiro a Dilma, depois o resto. Esse não era o discurso dos movimentos que levaram milhares de brasileiros às ruas? Pois o depois se tornou o presente. Chegou a hora do “resto”.
Seguindo a lógica das campanhas políticas brasileiras, algumas coisas ficaram apenas na promessa, e “o resto” tentou ser esquecido. Em vez de “primeiro, a gente tira a Dilma e, depois, o resto”, primeiro, afastou-se a ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff, por ter alterado os gastos do governo sem consultar o Congresso. E, depois —dois dias depois— , o Senado alterou a lei, de forma a não se precisar mais da permissão do Congresso.
“Fora, Dilma.” E depois…?
Esquecer o que se promete ou que se fala é prática comum na classe política. O mesmo Michel Temer que hoje demonstra algum problema de visão — ou de matemática — ao estimar o tamanho das manifestações, há pouco mais de um ano classificava o impeachment como “impensável”.
“O impeachment é impensável, geraria uma crise institucional. Não tem base jurídica e nem política”
— Michel Temer (@MichelTemer) 30 de março de 2015
Já o presidente em exercício, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), foi certeiro e previu a repressão policial nas manifestações que viriam, ainda no início de 2015.
Rodrigo Maia: Impeachment, com as palavras do pres. Lula, nao vai ser como Collor. Vai ser com muito sangue na rua. http://t.co/rHsYUTAumq — Mônica Bergamo (@monicabergamo) 1 de março de 2015
Mas isso não o impediu de votar a favor e, inclusive, dedicar o voto a seu pai, Cesar Maia. Ironicamente, Maia, o pai, teve o mandato cassado na semana final do julgamento do impeachment de Rousseff. Ele contratou seu cunhado, o advogado Paulo Eduardo de Araújo Saboya, 27 vezes sem licitação. Os contratos somam R$ 220 mil.
Outro que teve visão foi o ex-presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Em 2012, durante uma entrevista para o jornal Folha de S. Paulo, o sociólogo cantou a pedra, em pleno período de elogiada “faxina ética”:
“Quando Jango caiu, era claro que ele havia perdido a capacidade de governar porque o Congresso não seguia mais as determinações. O Congresso bloqueia. Jânio caiu porque se chocou com o Congresso também. Tinha a maioria do povo, mas não tinha o Congresso. O Collor, também. O Lula entendeu [o papel do Congresso], talvez, não no sentido que eu acharia melhor. Ele cedeu no que não deveria ceder. Não sei se a Dilma percebe os riscos.” [ênfase adicionado]
Três anos depois, no entanto, em março de 2015 durante outra entrevista à imprensa, desta vez ao jornal Estado de São Paulo, ele afirmou que “o caminho” era o impeachment. Disse também que “as ruas gritaram renúncia, fim, impeachment”.
Agora as ruas gritam “Fora, Temer”. Será que ele está ouvindo?
Após Temer desdenhar “40” manifestantes contra governo, SP tem maior protesto até agora. Mas PM não estimou público pic.twitter.com/og2TjGMawV — BuzzFeedNewsBR (@BuzzFeedNewsBR) 4 de setembro de 2016
Já o ex-presidente e hoje senador Fernando Collor (PTC-AL) disse ao jornal gaúcho Zero Hora, em 2014, que era partidário do “Fica, Dilma”.
REPÓRTER – O senhor vai votar na presidente Dilma?
COLLOR – Vou votar na Dilma.
REPÓRTER – Não é daqueles que engrossam o coro do “Volta, Lula”?
COLLOR – Não! Eu sou dos que engrossam o de “Fica, Dilma” (risos).
Aparentemente, ele mudou de ideia ao longo dos anos. Em 2016, disse sim ao impeachment, lembrando em seu voto o impeachment que ele mesmo sofreu, em 1992. Disse que “o rito é o mesmo, mas o ritmo e o vigor, não”, indicando que seu processo foi muito mais rápido do que o que levou ao afastamento de Rousseff.
Collor só esqueceu de citar em seu voto que os dois processos de impeachment são bem diferentes. No seu caso, envolveu alegações de crimes como corrupção passiva e formação de quadrilha, enquanto Rousseff respondia por suposta crime de responsabilidade fiscal.
Essa aparente confusão mental não é exclusiva da direita, tampouco do atual governo. A ex-candidata à presidência Luciana Genro (PSOL-RS) discordava totalmente da hipótese de um golpe, em março de 2016, quando diz, “os líderes do PT estão brincando com as palavras, dizendo que há golpe.” Mas apenas cinco meses depois classificou de “golpe palaciano” o que estava acontecendo no país:“Eu, que não votei em Temer nem para vice-presidente, é claro que não o aceito como presidente. Ainda mais quando sua presidência definitiva é produto de um golpe palaciano desferido no seu antigo aliado, o PT, que com ele compartilhou o poder por anos.”
E como esquecer a ainda candidata Dilma Rousseff exaltando seu então candidato a vice-presidente, Michel Temer, dizendo que ele saberia “honrar e me substituir à altura”? O que, depois, lamentou profundamente.
Essa aparente mudança de posição não pega desprevenido quem acompanha o noticiário de Brasília. Quem ouviu os áudios dos grampos de Sérgio Machado divulgados em maio de 2016 já sabia que o “Fora, Dilma” não seria seguido do “depois o resto”. O ex-presidente da Transpetro gravou suas negociações com o ex-ministro do planejamento Romero Jucá (PMDB-RR) sobre uma forma de afastar Rousseff para, assim, estancar o avanço da operação Lava Jato. Apenas para refrescar a memória:
MACHADO – Rapaz, a solução mais fácil era botar o Michel [Temer].
JUCÁ – Só o Renan [Calheiros] que está contra essa porra. ‘Porque não gosta do Michel, porque o Michel é Eduardo Cunha’. Gente, esquece o Eduardo Cunha, o Eduardo Cunha está morto, porra.
MACHADO – É um acordo, botar o Michel, num grande acordo nacional.
JUCÁ – Com o Supremo, com tudo.
MACHADO – Com tudo, aí parava tudo.
JUCÁ – É. Delimitava onde está, pronto.
Quem quiser lembrar da gravação completa, aqui vai.
Assim se monta a realidade em que o governo fala que não vai mexer nos programas sociais, mas pede um corte médio de 30% nos mesmos; ou que fala em corte de gastos, mas adota medidas que não trazem corte efetivo de despesas.
Enquanto isso, o povo volta às ruas. Porque, por mais que se diga que tem ele memória curta, ele se lembra.
ATUALIZAÇÃO:
The Intercept Brasil solicitou via Twitter que os leitores enviassem mais casos como os relatados acima. Abaixo, os melhores exemplos apontados por leitores até agora:
Durante a campanha de 2014 Rousseff já sabia que “sem apoio no Congresso Nacional não é possível assegurar um governo estável”, como ela mesma disse durante um dos debates daquele ano. Inclusive, a então candidata chegou a mencionar em seu programa eleitoral que Marina Silva (Rede) poderia sofrer impeachment por ter uma base restrita no parlamento.
https://twitter.com/belisards/status/772985302570983424
O senador Telmário Mota (PDT-RR) pediu a suspensão e o arquivamento do impeachment ao Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) em abril de 2016, mas votou a favor do afastamento de Dilma no julgamento, dia 31 de agosto. Dois dias antes, ele havia defendido a então presidente e dito que não havia crime de responsabilidade.

Entre outros nomes, Eduardo Cunha também mudou de opinião sobre o impeachment. Fomos atrás da dica e encontramos uma entrevista do então presidente da Câmara no programa Roda Viva em março de 2015. Entre as muitas coisas que ele disse durante mais de uma hora de gravação, destaca-se o trecho abaixo:
“Nós não podemos transformar a discussão sobre o impedimento de um presidente da república numa forma de discussão política, porque ele não é. O impedimento tem as suas previsões constitucionais para os casos específicos aos quais, no meu entender, não está se aplicando. Então, consequentemente, eu não posso querer dar curso para resolver uma crise política. Achar que a gente virou uma republiqueta que vai arrancar o presidente fora, que foi legitimamente eleito. Nós não concordamos com essa forma.” [ênfase adicionado]
Como se bem sabe, Cunha ficou conhecido como aquele que entregou o impeachment em troca de “anistia”.
https://twitter.com/MCeceCT/status/772942539838132224
Encontramos mudanças de posição de Telmário Mota e Eduardo Cunha, mas não encontramos opiniões anteriores de Renan Calheiros, que preferiu guardar para si a decisão até o último minuto. Uma semana antes da votação final, Calheiros sequer dava certeza se iria votar ou não no julgamento.
Com os agradecimentos aos leitores @MCeceCT, @carolisoms e @belisards.
JÁ ESTÁ ACONTECENDO
Quando o assunto é a ascensão da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa é uma preocupação só para anos eleitorais. Mas o projeto de poder bolsonarista nunca dorme.
A grande mídia, o agro, as forças armadas, as megaigrejas e as big techs bilionárias ganharam força nas eleições municipais — e têm uma vantagem enorme para 2026.
Não podemos ficar alheios enquanto somos arrastados para o retrocesso, afogados em fumaça tóxica e privados de direitos básicos. Já passou da hora de agir. Juntos.
A meta ousada do Intercept para 2025 é nada menos que derrotar o golpe em andamento antes que ele conclua sua missão. Para isso, dependemos do apoio de nossos leitores.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/06/nsa-menwith-hill-targeted-killing-surveillance/,The NSA's British Base at the Heart of U.S. Targeted Killing,"The narrow roads are quiet and winding, surrounded by rolling green fields and few visible signs of life beyond the occasional herd of sheep. But on the horizon, massive white golf ball-like domes protrude from the earth, protected behind a perimeter fence that is topped with piercing razor wire. Here, in the heart of the tranquil English countryside, is the National Security Agency’s largest overseas spying base.
Once known only by the code name Field Station 8613, the secret base — now called Menwith Hill Station — is located about nine miles west of the small town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire. Originally used to monitor Soviet communications through the Cold War, its focus has since dramatically shifted, and today it is a vital part of the NSA’s sprawling global surveillance network.
For years, journalists and researchers have speculated about what really goes on inside Menwith Hill, while human rights groups and some politicians have campaigned for more transparency about its activities. Yet the British government has steadfastly refused to comment, citing a longstanding policy not to discuss matters related to national security.
Now, however, top-secret documents obtained by The Intercept offer an unprecedented glimpse behind Menwith Hill’s razor wire fence. The files reveal for the first time how the NSA has used the British base to aid “a significant number of capture-kill operations” across the Middle East and North Africa, fueled by powerful eavesdropping technology that can harvest data from more than 300 million emails and phone calls a day.
Over the past decade, the documents show, the NSA has pioneered groundbreaking new spying programs at Menwith Hill to pinpoint the locations of suspected terrorists accessing the internet in remote parts of the world. The programs — with names such as GHOSTHUNTER and GHOSTWOLF — have provided support for conventional British and American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. But they have also aided covert missions in countries where the U.S. has not declared war. NSA employees at Menwith Hill have collaborated on a project to help “eliminate” terrorism targets in Yemen, for example, where the U.S. has waged a controversial drone bombing campaign that has resulted in dozens of civilian deaths.
The disclosures about Menwith Hill raise new questions about the extent of British complicity in U.S. drone strikes and other so-called targeted killing missions, which may in some cases have violated international laws or constituted war crimes. Successive U.K. governments have publicly stated that all activities at the base are carried out with the “full knowledge and consent” of British officials.
The revelations are “yet another example of the unacceptable level of secrecy that surrounds U.K. involvement in the U.S. ‘targeted killing’ program,” Kat Craig, legal director of London-based human rights group Reprieve, told The Intercept.
“It is now imperative that the prime minister comes clean about U.K. involvement in targeted killing,” Craig said, “to ensure that British personnel and resources are not implicated in illegal and immoral activities.”
The British government’s Ministry of Defence, which handles media inquires related to Menwith Hill, declined to comment for this story.
The NSA referred a request for comment to the Director of National Intelligence’s office.
Richard Kolko, a spokesperson for the DNI, said in a statement: “The men and women serving the intelligence community safeguard U.S. national security by collecting information, conducting analysis, and providing intelligence for informed decision making under a strict set of laws, policies and guidelines. This mission protects our nation and others around the world.”
The equipment at Menwith Hill covers roughly one square mile, which is patrolled 24 hours a day by armed British military police and monitored by cameras perched on posts that peer down on almost every section of the 10-foot perimeter fence.
Most visible from the outside are a cluster of about 30 of the giant white domes. But the site also houses a self-contained community, accessible only to those with security clearance. Among operations buildings in which analysts listen in on monitored conversations, there is a bowling alley, a small pool hall, a bar, a fast food restaurant, and a general store.
Most of the world’s international phone calls, internet traffic, emails, and other communications are sent over a network of undersea cables that connect countries like giant arteries. At spy outposts across the world, the NSA and its partners tap into these cables to monitor the data flowing through them. But Menwith Hill is focused on a different kind of surveillance: eavesdropping on communications as they are being transmitted through the air.
According to top-secret documents obtained by The Intercept from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, Menwith Hill has two main spying capabilities. The first is called FORNSAT, which uses powerful antennae contained within the golf ball-like domes to eavesdrop on communications as they are being beamed between foreign satellites. The second is called OVERHEAD, which uses U.S. government satellites orbiting above targeted countries to locate and monitor wireless communications on the ground below — such as cellphone calls and even WiFi traffic.
In the late 1980s, international communication networks were revolutionized by new fiber-optic undersea cables. The technology was cheaper than satellites and could transmit data across the world much faster than ever before, at almost the speed of light. For this reason, according to the NSA’s documents, in the mid-1990s the U.S. intelligence community was convinced that satellite communications would soon become obsolete, to be fully replaced by fiber-optic cable networks.
But the prediction proved to be wrong. And millions of phone calls are still beamed between satellites today, alongside troves of internet data, which the NSA has readily exploited at Menwith Hill.
“The commercial satellite communication business is alive and well and bursting at the seams with increasingly sophisticated bulk DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) traffic that is largely unencrypted,” the NSA reported in a 2006 document. “This data source alone provides more data for Menwith Hill analysts to sift through than our entire enterprise had to deal with in the not-so-distant past.”
The U.S. and U.K. governments have actively misled the public for years through a “cover story.”
As of 2009, Menwith Hill’s foreign satellite surveillance mission, code-named MOONPENNY, was monitoring 163 different satellite data links. The intercepted communications were funneled into a variety of different repositories storing phone calls, text messages, emails, internet browsing histories, and other data.
It is not clear precisely how many communications Menwith Hill is capable of tapping into at any one time, but the NSA’s documents indicate the number is extremely large. In a single 12-hour period in May 2011, for instance, its surveillance systems logged more than 335 million metadata records, which reveal information such as the sender and recipient of an email, or the phone numbers someone called and at what time.
To keep information about Menwith Hill’s surveillance role secret, the U.S. and U.K. governments have actively misled the public for years through a “cover story” portraying the base as a facility used to provide “rapid radio relay and conduct communications research.” A classified U.S. document, dated from 2005, cautioned spy agency employees against revealing the truth. “It is important to know the established cover story for MHS [Menwith Hill Station] and to protect the fact that MHS is an intelligence collection facility,” the document stated. “Any reference to satellites being operated or any connection to intelligence gathering is strictly prohibited.”
The outpost was built in the 1950s as part of a deal made by the British and American governments to house U.S. personnel and surveillance equipment. In its early days, Menwith Hill’s technology was much more primitive. According to Kenneth Bird, who worked at the base in the 1960s during the Cold War, it was focused then on monitoring high frequency radio signals in Eastern Europe. Intercepted conversations were recorded on Ampex tape recorders, Bird noted in his published 1997 account, with some transcribed by analysts in real-time using typewriters.
The modern Menwith Hill is a very different place. Now, not only are its spying systems capable of vacuuming up far more communications, but they also have a far broader geographic reach. In addition, the targets of the surveillance have drastically changed, as have the purposes for which the eavesdropping is carried out.
The documents obtained by The Intercept reveal that spy satellites operated at Menwith Hill today can target communications in China and Latin America, and also provide “continuous coverage of the majority of the Eurasian landmass,” where they intercept “tactical military, scientific, political, and economic communications signals.” But perhaps the most significant role the base has played in recent years has been in the Middle East and North Africa.
Especially in remote parts of the world where there are no fiber-optic cable links, it is common for internet connections and phone calls to be routed over satellite. Consequently, Menwith Hill became a vital asset in the U.S. government’s counterterrorism campaign after the 9/11 attacks. Since then, the base has been used extensively to tap into communications in otherwise hard-to-reach areas where Islamic extremist groups such as al Qaeda and al Shabaab have been known to operate — for example, in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, Somalia, and Yemen.
Crucially, however, Menwith Hill has been used for more than just gathering intelligence on people and governments across countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Surveillance tools such as the GHOSTHUNTER system were developed to directly aid military operations, pinpointing the locations of targeted people or groups so that they could then be captured or killed.
The NSA’s documents describe GHOSTHUNTER as a means “to locate targets when they log onto the internet.” It was first developed in 2006 as “the only capability of its kind” and it enabled “a significant number of capture-kill operations” against alleged terrorists. Only a few specific examples are given, but those cases give a remarkable insight into the extraordinary power of the technology.
In 2007, for instance, analysts at Menwith Hill used GHOSTHUNTER to help track down a suspected al Qaeda “facilitator” in Lebanon who was described as “highly actionable,” meaning he had been deemed a legitimate target to kill or capture. The location of the target — who was known by several names, including Abu Sumayah — was traced to within a few hundred meters based on intercepts of his communications. Then a spy satellite took an aerial photograph of the neighborhood in Sidon, south Lebanon, in which he was believed to be living, mapping out the surrounding streets and houses. A top-secret document detailing the surveillance indicates that the information was to be passed to a secretive special operations unit known as Task Force 11-9, which would have been equipped to conduct a covert raid to kill or capture Sumayah. The outcome of the operation, however, is unclear, as it is not revealed in the document.
In another case in 2007, GHOSTHUNTER was used to identify an alleged al Qaeda “weapons procurer” in Iraq named Abu Sayf. The NSA’s surveillance systems spotted Sayf logging into Yahoo email or messenger accounts at an internet cafe near a mosque in Anah, a town on the Euphrates River that is about 200 miles northwest of Baghdad. Analysts at Menwith Hill used GHOSTHUNTER to track down his location and spy satellites operated from the British base captured aerial images. This information was passed to U.S. military commanders based in Fallujah to be included as part of a “targeting plan.”
A few days later, a special operations unit named Task Force-16 stormed two properties, where they detained Sayf, his father, two brothers, and five associates.
By 2008, the apparent popularity of GHOSTHUNTER within the intelligence community meant that it was rolled out at other surveillance bases where NSA has a presence, including in Ayios Nikolaos, Cyprus, and Misawa, Japan. The expansion of the capability to the other bases meant that it now had “near-global coverage.” But Menwith Hill remained its most important surveillance site. “[Menwith Hill] still supplies about 99% of the FORNSAT data used in GHOSTHUNTER geolocations,” noted a January 2008 document about the program.
A 2009 document added that GHOSTHUNTER’s focus was at that time “on geolocation of internet cafés in the Middle East/North Africa region in support of U.S. military operations” and said that it had to date “successfully geolocated over 5,000 VSAT terminals in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran.” VSAT, or Very Small Aperture Terminal, is a satellite system commonly used by internet cafés and foreign governments in the Middle East to send and receive communications and data. GHOSTHUNTER could also home in on VSATs in Pakistan, Somalia, Algeria, the Philippines, Mali, Kenya, and Sudan, the documents indicate.
Menwith Hill’s unique ability to track down satellite devices across the world at times placed it on the front line of conflicts thousands of miles away. In Afghanistan, for instance, analysts at the base used the VSAT surveillance to help track down suspected members of the Taliban, which led to “approximately 30 enemy killed” during one series of attacks that were mentioned in a top-secret July 2011 report. In early 2012, Menwith Hill’s analysts were again called upon to track down a VSAT: this time, to assist British special forces in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province. The terminal was swiftly located, and within an hour an MQ-9 Reaper drone was dispatched to the area, presumably to launch an airstrike.
But the lethal use of the surveillance data does not appear to have been restricted to conventional war zones such as Afghanistan or Iraq. The NSA developed similar methods at Menwith Hill to track down terror suspects in Yemen, where the U.S. has waged a covert drone war against militants associated with al Qaeda in the Northern Peninsula.
In early 2010, the agency revealed in an internal report that it had launched a new technique at the British base to identify many targets “at almost 40 different geolocated internet cafés” in Yemen’s Shabwah province and in the country’s capital, Sanaa. The technique, the document revealed, was linked to a broader classified initiative called GHOSTWOLF, described as a project to “capture or eliminate key nodes in terrorist networks” by focusing primarily on “providing actionable geolocation intelligence derived from [surveillance] to customers and their operational components.”
The description of GHOSTWOLF ties Menwith Hill to lethal operations in Yemen, providing the first documentary evidence that directly implicates the U.K. in covert actions in the country.
Menwith Hill’s previously undisclosed role aiding the so-called targeted killing of terror suspects highlights the extent of the British government’s apparent complicity in controversial U.S. attacks — and raises questions about the legality of the secret operations carried out from the base.
There are some 2,200 personnel at Menwith Hill, the majority of whom are Americans. Alongside NSA employees within the complex, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office also has a major presence at the site, running its own “ground station” from which it controls a number of spy satellites.
But the British government has publicly asserted as recently as 2014 that operations at the base “have always been, and continue to be” carried out with its “knowledge and consent.” Moreover, roughly 600 of the personnel at the facility are from U.K. agencies, including employees of the NSA’s British counterpart Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.
For several years, British human rights campaigners and lawmakers have been pressuring the government to provide information about whether it has had any role aiding U.S. targeted killing operations, yet they have been met with silence. In particular, there has been an attempt to establish whether the U.K. has aided U.S. drone bombings outside of declared war zones — in countries including Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia — which have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and are in some cases considered by United Nations officials to possibly constitute war crimes and violations of international law.
Though the Snowden documents analyzed by The Intercept state that Menwith Hill has aided “a significant number” of “capture-kill” operations, they do not reveal specific details about all of the incidents that resulted in fatalities. What is clear, however, is that the base has targeted countries such as Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia as part of location-tracking programs like GHOSTHUNTER and GHOSTWOLF — which were created to help pinpoint individuals so they could be captured or killed — suggesting it has played a part in drone strikes in these countries.
“An individual involved in passing that information is likely to be an accessory to murder.”
Craig, the legal director at Reprieve, reviewed the Menwith Hill documents — and said that they indicated British complicity in covert U.S. drone attacks. “For years, Reprieve and others have sought clarification from the British government about the role of U.K. bases in the U.S. covert drone program, which has killed large numbers of civilians in countries where we are not at war,” she told The Intercept. “We were palmed off with platitudes and reassured that any U.S. activities on or involving British bases were fully compliant with domestic and international legal provisions. It now appears that this was far from the truth.”
Jemima Stratford QC, a leading British human rights lawyer, told The Intercept that there were “serious questions to be asked and serious arguments to be made” about the legality of the lethal operations aided from Menwith Hill. The operations, Stratford said, could have violated the European Convention on Human Rights, an international treaty that the U.K. still remains bound to despite its recent vote to leave the European Union. Article 2 of the Convention protects the “right to life” and states that “no one shall be deprived of his life intentionally” except when it is ordered by a court as a punishment for a crime.
Stratford has previously warned that if British officials have facilitated covert U.S. drone strikes outside of declared war zones, they could even be implicated in murder. In 2014, she advised members of the U.K. Parliament that because the U.S. is not at war with countries such as Yemen or Pakistan, in the context of English and international law, the individuals who are targeted by drones in these countries are not “combatants” and their killers are not entitled to “combatant immunity.”
“If the U.K. government knows that it is transferring data that may be used for drone strikes against non-combatants … that transfer is probably unlawful,” Stratford told the members of Parliament. “An individual involved in passing that information is likely to be an accessory to murder.”
GCHQ refused to answer questions for this story, citing a “long standing policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters.” A spokesperson for the agency issued a generic statement asserting that “all of GCHQ’s work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.” The spokesperson insisted that “U.K.’s interception regime is entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.”
In February 2014, the U.S. Department of Defense announced after a review that it was planning to reduce personnel at Menwith Hill by 2016, with about 500 service members and civilians set to be removed from the site. A U.S. Air Force spokesperson told the military newspaper Stars and Stripes that the decision was based on technological advances, which he declined to discuss, though he mentioned improvements in “server capacity to the hardware that we’re using; we’re doing more with less.”
The documents provided by Snowden shine light on some of the specific technological changes. Most notably, they show that there has been significant investment in introducing new and more sophisticated mass surveillance systems at Menwith Hill in recent years. A crucial moment came in 2008, when then-NSA Director Keith Alexander introduced a radical shift in policy. Visiting Menwith Hill in June that year, Alexander set a challenge for employees at the base. “Why can’t we collect all the signals, all the time?” he said, according to NSA documents. “Sounds like a good summer homework project for Menwith.”
As a result, a new “collection posture” was introduced at the base, the aim being to “collect it all, process it all, exploit it all.” In other words, it would vacuum up as many communications within its reach as technologically possible.
Between 2009 and 2012, Menwith Hill spent more than $40 million on a massive new 95,000-square-foot operations building — nearly twice the size of an average American football field. A large chunk of this space — 10,000 square feet — was set aside for a data center that boasted the ability to store huge troves of intercepted communications. During the renovations, the NSA shipped in new computer systems and laid 182 miles of cables, enough to stretch from New York City to the outskirts of Boston. The agency also had a 200-seat-capacity auditorium constructed to host classified operations meetings and other events.
“How can Menwith carry out operations of which there is absolutely no accountability to the public?”
Some of the extensive expansion work was visible from the road outside the secure complex, which triggered protests from a local activist group called the Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases. Since the early 1990s, the group has closely monitored activities at Menwith Hill. And for the last 16 years, its members have held a small demonstration every Tuesday outside the base’s main entrance, greeting NSA employees with flags and colorful homemade banners bearing slogans critical of U.S. foreign policy and drone strikes.
Fabian Hamilton, a member of Parliament based in the nearby city of Leeds, has become a supporter of the campaign’s work, occasionally attending events organized by the group and advocating for more transparency at Menwith Hill. Hamilton, who represents the Labour Party, has doggedly attempted to find out basic information about the base, asking the government at least 40 parliamentary questions since 2010 about its activities. He has sought clarification on a variety of issues, such as how many U.S. personnel are stationed at the site, whether it is involved in conducting drone strikes, and whether members of a British parliamentary oversight committee have been given full access to review its operations. But his efforts have been repeatedly stonewalled, with British government officials refusing to provide any details on the grounds of national security.
Hamilton told The Intercept that he found the secrecy shrouding Menwith Hill to be “offensive.” The revelations about the role it has played in U.S. killing and capture operations, he said, showed there needed to be a full review of its operations. “Any nation-state that uses military means to attack any target, whether it is a terrorist, whether it is legitimate or not, has to be accountable to its electorate for what it does,” Hamilton said. “That’s the basis of our Parliament, it’s the basis of our whole democratic system. How can we say that Menwith can carry out operations of which there is absolutely no accountability to the public? I don’t buy this idea that you say the word ‘security’ and nobody can know anything. We need to know what is being done in our name.”

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/06/the-unrelenting-pundit-led-effort-to-delegitimize-all-negative-reporting-about-hillary-clinton/,The Unrelenting Pundit-Led Effort to Delegitimize All Negative Reporting About Hillary Clinton,"In his New York Times column yesterday, Paul Krugman did something that he made clear he regarded as quite brave: He defended the Democratic Party presidential nominee and likely next U.S. president from journalistic investigations. Complaining about media bias, Krugman claimed that journalists are driven by “the presumption that anything Hillary Clinton does must be corrupt, most spectacularly illustrated by the increasingly bizarre coverage of the Clinton Foundation.” While generously acknowledging that it was legitimate to take a look at the billions of dollars raised by the Clintons as Hillary pursued increasing levels of political power — vast sums often received from the very parties most vested in her decisions as a public official — it is now “very clear,” he proclaimed, that there was absolutely nothing improper about any of what she or her husband did.
Krugman’s column, chiding the media for its unfairly negative coverage of his beloved candidate, was, predictably, a big hit among Democrats — not just because of their agreement with its content but because of what they regarded as the remarkable courage required to publicly defend someone as marginalized and besieged as the former first lady, two-term New York senator, secretary of state, and current establishment-backed multimillionaire presidential front-runner. Krugman — in a tweet proclamation that has now been re-tweeted more than 10,000 times — heralded himself this way: “I was reluctant to write today’s column because I knew journos would hate it. But it felt like a moral duty.”

As my colleague Zaid Jilani remarked: “I can imagine Paul Krugman standing in front of the mirror saying, ‘This is *your Tahrir Square* big guy.’” Nate Silver, early yesterday morning, even suggested that Krugman’s Clinton-defending column was so edgy and threatening that the New York Times — which published the column — was effectively suppressing Krugman’s brave stance by refusing to promote it on Twitter (the NYT tweeted Krugman’s column a few hours later, early in the afternoon). Thankfully, it appears that Krugman — at least thus far — has suffered no governmental recriminations or legal threats, nor any career penalties, for his intrepid, highly risky defense of Hillary Clinton.
That’s because — in contrast to his actually brave, orthodoxy-defying work in 2002 as one of the few media voices opposed to the invasion of Iraq, for which he deserves eternal credit — Krugman here is doing little more than echoing conventional media wisdom. That prominent journalists are overwhelmingly opposed to Donald Trump is barely debatable; their collective contempt for him is essentially out in the open, which is where it should be. Contrary to Krugman’s purported expectation, countless Clinton-supporting journalists rushed to express praise for Krugman. Indeed, with very few exceptions, U.S. elites across the board — from both parties, spanning multiple ideologies — are aligned with unprecedented unity against Donald Trump. The last thing required to denounce him, or to defend Hillary Clinton, is bravery.
That wasn’t true at first: For a long time, journalists refused to take the dangers posed by Trump’s campaign seriously. In March 2016, I wrote a column denouncing the U.S. media for venerating feigned neutrality over its responsibility to sound the alarm about how extremist and menacing Trump’s candidacy really is. But in the last few months, Trump’s media portrayal has been overwhelmingly (and justifiably) negative; his shady business scams have been endlessly investigated and dissected (often on the front page of the NYT); he and his surrogates are subjected to remarkably (and fairly) harsh interviews; his pathological lying has been unequivocally chronicled by numerous media outlets; and few journalists have suppressed their horror at his most extremist policies. As BuzzFeed’s Tom Gara put it last month: “My Twitter timeline is now just a continuous rolling denunciation of Donald Trump.”

That American journalists have dispensed with muted tones and fake neutrality when reporting on Trump is a positive development. He and his rhetoric pose genuine threats, and the U.S. media would be irresponsible if it failed to make that clear. But aggressive investigative journalism against Trump is not enough for Democratic partisans whose voice is dominant in U.S. media discourse. They also want a cessation of any news coverage that reflects negatively on Hillary Clinton. Most, of course, won’t say this explicitly (though some do), but — as the wildly adored Krugman column from yesterday reflects — they will just reflexively dismiss any such coverage as illegitimate and invalid.
It should be the opposite of surprising, or revealing, that pundits loyally devoted to a particular candidate dislike all reporting that reflects negatively on that candidate. There is probably no more die-hard Clinton loyalist in the U.S. media than Paul Krugman. He has used his column for years to defend her and attack any of her critics. Indeed, in 2008, he was the first to observe that — in his words — “the Obama campaign seems dangerously close to becoming a cult of personality,” comparing the adulation Clinton’s 2008 primary opponent was receiving to the swooning over George W. Bush’s flight suit. He spent the 2016 primary maligning Sanders supporters as unstable, unserious losers (the straight, white, male columnist also regularly referred to them — including female and LGBT Sanders supporters — as “bros”). And now he’s assigned himself the role as Arbiter of Proper Journalism, and — along with virtually all other Clinton-supporting pundits and journalists — has oh-so-surprisingly ruled that all journalism that reflects poorly on Hillary Clinton is unsubstantiated, biased, and deceitful.
The absolute last metric journalists should use for determining what to cover is the reaction of pundits who, like Krugman and plenty of others, are singularly devoted to the election of one of the candidates. Of course Hillary Clinton’s die-hard loyalists in the media will dislike, and find invalid, any suggestion that she engaged in any sort of questionable conduct. Their self-assigned role is to defend her from all criticisms. They view themselves more as campaign operatives than journalists: Their principal, overriding goal is to ensure that Clinton wins the election. They will obviously hate anything — particularly negative reporting about her — that conflicts with that goal. They will jettison even their core stated beliefs — such as the view that big-money donations corrupt politicians — in order to fulfill that goal.
But it would be journalistic malpractice of the highest order if the billions of dollars received by the Clintons — both personally and though their various entities — were not rigorously scrutinized and exposed in detail by reporters. That’s exactly what they ought to be doing. The fact that quid pro quos cannot be definitively proven does not remotely negate the urgency of this journalism. That’s because quid pro quos by their nature elude such proof (can anyone prove that Republicans steadfastly support Israel and low taxes because of the millions they get from Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers, or that the Florida attorney general decided not to prosecute Trump because his foundation and his daughter donated to her?). Beyond quid quo pros, the Clintons’ constant, pioneering merger of massive private wealth and political power and influence is itself highly problematic. Nobody forced them to take millions of dollars from the Saudis and Goldman Sachs tycoons and corporations with vested interests in the State Department; having chosen to do so with great personal benefit, they are now confronting the consequences in how the public views such behavior.
That Donald Trump is an uber-nationalist, bigotry-exploiting demagogue and unstable extremist does not remotely entitle Hillary Clinton to waltz into the Oval Office free of aggressive journalistic scrutiny. Nor does Trump’s extremism constitute a defense to anything that she’s done. It is absolutely true that Trump has at least as many troublesome financial transactions and entangling relationships as the Clintons do: These donations to the Florida attorney general are among the most corrupt-appearing transactions yet documented. Even worse, Trump has shielded himself from much needed scrutiny by inexcusably refusing to release his tax returns, while much of the reporting about the Clintons is possible only because they have released theirs. All of that is important and should be highlighted.
But none of it suggests that anything other than a bright journalistic light is appropriate for examining the Clintons’ conduct. Yet there are prominent pundits and journalists who literally denounce every critical report about Clinton as unfair and deceitful, and band together to malign the reporters who scrutinize the Clintons’ financial transactions. Those prominent voices combine with the million-dollar online army that supreme sleaze merchant David Brock has assembled to attack Clinton critics; as the Los Angeles Times reported in May: “Clinton’s well-heeled backers have opened a new frontier in digital campaigning, one that seems to have been inspired by some of the internet’s worst instincts. Correct the Record, a Super PAC coordinating with Clinton’s campaign, is spending some $1 million to find and confront social media users who post unflattering messages about the Democratic front-runner.”
All of this means that any journalists reporting negatively on Clinton are instantly and widely bombarded with criticisms denouncing their work as illegitimate, as they’ve started noting:
Clinton backers' shaming of the press for reporting anything the Clinton campaign dislikes is rapidly approaching self-parody territory.

It’s very common for political factions to believe that they’re persecuted and victimized. Even with the overwhelming bulk of the national media so openly aligned against Trump — with an endless array of investigative stories showing Trump to be an unscrupulous con artist and pathological liar — Clinton supporters seem to genuinely believe that the media is actually biased against their candidate.
The reality is that large, pro-Clinton liberal media platforms — such as Vox, and the Huffington Post, and prime-time MSNBC programs, and the columnists and editorialists of the New York Times and the Washington Post, and most major New York-based weekly magazines — have been openly campaigning for Hillary Clinton. I don’t personally see anything wrong with that — I’m glad when journalists shed their faux objectivity; I believe the danger of Trump’s candidacy warrants that; and I hope this candor continues past the November election — but the everyone-is-against-us self-pity from Clinton partisans is just a joke. They are the dominant voices in elite media discourse, and it’s a big reason why Clinton is highly likely to win.
That’s all the more reason why journalists should be subjecting Clinton’s financial relationships, associations, and secret communications to as much scrutiny as Donald Trump’s. That certainly does not mean that journalists should treat their various sins and transgressions as equivalent: Nothing in the campaign compares to Trump’s deport-11-million-people or ban-all-Muslim policies, or his attacks on a judge for his Mexican ethnicity, etc. But this emerging narrative that Clinton should not only enjoy the support of a virtually united elite class but also a scrutiny-free march into the White House is itself quite dangerous. Clinton partisans in the media — including those who regard themselves as journalists — will continue to reflexively attack all reporting that reflects negatively on her, but that reporting should nonetheless continue with unrestrained aggression.",Glenn Greenwald,2016-09-06,success

But if you’re an American relying on cable news, it would be hard to know it ever happened.
Not a single American cable news network ran a segment focused on India’s massive strike, even on Labor Day, the U.S.’s annual holiday dedicated to workers.
The strike came after Modi began a push for increased foreign investment and privatization of some state-run industries. Unions fear these policies will undermine both wages and employment.
The size of the strike alone forced the government to offer concessions prior to Friday in an attempt to avert it, offering a boost in the minimum wage for some non-skilled workers and the unfreezing of some public employee bonuses.
The unions were not persuaded by this offer. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his fight is with poverty, but it seems his fight is with the poor in this country,” Indian National Trade Union Congress Vice President Ashok Singh said prior to the strike.
The unions petitioned the government with a list of demands, including a call to increase the minimum wage to 18,000 rupees a month (around $271 USD). India-based The Hindu published a short video report on the strike with English subtitles. Watch it here:
The only mention of the strike on U.S.-based cable news was during a segment on CNN International where the CEO of the human resources consulting firm ManpowerGroup cited the Indian strike as part of global concerns about technology suppressing wages.",Zaid Jilani,2016-09-06,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/07/white-house-report-concludes-that-bite-mark-analysis-is-junk-science/,White House Report Concludes That Bite-Mark Analysis Is Junk Science,"The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has concluded that forensic bite-mark evidence is not scientifically valid and is unlikely ever to be validated, according to a draft report obtained by The Intercept. The report, titled “Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods,” is marked as a “predecisional” draft created August 26 that is not to be quoted or distributed, though the title page suggests the report will be made public sometime this month.
The report reviews a handful of common forensic practices, so called feature-comparison disciplines, or pattern-matching practices — bite-mark analysis, fingerprint and firearm analysis, shoe tread analysis, and DNA mixture analysis — each of which involves an “expert” looking at a piece of evidence and eyeballing whether it matches a particular image, person, or object. The report discusses whether each practice has been scientifically validated, what it would take to do so, and how each practice should be used in the courtroom — if at all.
In the case of bite-mark evidence, the report is especially critical. “PCAST finds that bitemark analysis does not meet the scientific standards for foundational validity, and is far from meeting such standards,” it reads. “To the contrary, available scientific evidence strongly suggests that examiners cannot consistently agree on whether an injury is a human bitemark and cannot identify the source of [a] bitemark with reasonable accuracy.”
Bite-mark analysis is conducted by forensic dentists and relies on two foundational premises: first, that human dentition is unique — as unique as DNA — and second, that human skin (or another malleable substrate) is a suitable medium on which to record such an impression. The problem is that neither premise has been proved. Nonetheless, bite-mark analysis has been used in criminal cases to match individuals to alleged bites since the 1950s, when Texas’s highest criminal court cleared the way for its use (in that case, a dentist claimed that a bite mark left in a piece of cheese found at the scene of a grocery burglary matched the teeth of a particular man).
Although bite-mark matching is nowhere near as ubiquitous as, say, fingerprint analysis in the criminal justice system, it has left a string of victims in its wake. To date, 25 wrongful arrests or convictions have been linked to bite-mark analysis and additional cases are still pending in the courts, according to the Innocence Project. In June, Bill Richards was freed from prison after spending nearly 23 years behind bars for the murder of his wife in California based on the erroneous testimony of a forensic dentist who said a wound found on his wife Pamela’s hand was a match to Richards’s supposedly unusual dentition.
Despite their poor track record, many forensic dentists — most associated with the American Board of Forensic Odontology, the discipline’s certifying body — have remained rabidly defensive of their practice and the notion that it is a righteous undertaking that helps put criminals behind bars. An integral part of their defense has been to lash out at critics —even those among their own ranks. The group unsuccessfully tried to expel Dr. C. Michael Bowers from the American Academy of Forensic Sciences — the nation’s preeminent umbrella organization for forensic practitioners — on a trumped-up ethics charge. And they have attacked both professionally and personally Dr. Mary Bush and her husband, Peter, who have conducted significant research demonstrating the practice’s lack of a scientific underpinning. Notably, the PCAST report gives a distinct nod to the Bushes’ work in determining that there is no actual science behind bite-mark analysis.
While the report acknowledges the dentists’ concern that excluding bite-mark evidence “could hamper efforts to convict criminals in some cases,” it rejects the idea that this alone is sufficient to warrant the practice. If the dentists’ concerns are valid, “the correct solution, from a scientific perspective, would not be to admit expert testimony based on invalid and unreliable methods, but rather to attempt to develop scientifically valid methods,” it reads. “However, PCAST considers the prospects of developing bitemark analysis into a scientifically valid method to be low. We advise against devoting significant resources to such efforts.”
Pattern Matching, Subjectivity, and Junk Science
President Obama created the advisory council in 2009 as a means of gathering scientific input that could impact policy decisions. Although the practice of presidents naming scientific advisers dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration, the timing of the creation of Obama’s council was particularly notable, coming just roughly two months after the release of a groundbreaking report from the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council, which cast a long shadow over a host of pattern-matching forensic disciplines that have been used for decades in criminal cases. That report — “Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward” — noted a lack of scientific underpinning in nearly every forensic practice, except for DNA, and called for research to be done to shore up the disciplines.
In the wake of the NAS report, the government has taken action — a National Commission on Forensic Science was created, and a number of scientific working groups have undertaken the arduous task of coordinating the development of standards and guidelines for various forensic disciplines. PCAST was asked by Obama in September 2015 to see what additional efforts might be undertaken to aid the effort to instill science into forensics. Upon review, PCAST concluded “that the most useful contribution it could make would be to add clarity on the scientific meaning of ‘reliable principles and methods’ and ‘scientific validity’ in the context of certain forensic disciplines.”
Scientific validity and reliability mandate that each method be subjected to empirical testing in order to determine meaningful error rates. “Without appropriate estimates of accuracy, an examiner’s statement that two samples are similar — or even indistinguishable — is scientifically meaningless: it has no probative value and considerable potential for prejudicial impact,” reads the report. “Nothing — not training, personal experience nor professional practices — can substitute for adequate empirical demonstration of accuracy.”
To be fair, bite-mark analysis is not the only practice criticized by PCAST. Fingerprint matching has only recently been put to rigorous testing (it is “distressing” that it has taken so long to do so, the report notes), and two such studies produced high error rates — in one, an error rate of 1 in 18 was found, in the other 1 in 306. The report recommends that jurors be informed of the studies and their results.
Where firearm analysis is concerned, the group notes early studies indicate that examiners can, “under some circumstances,” connect spent ammunition to the gun from which it was fired, but also reports that just one appropriate study has so far been conducted and that other “frequently cited studies seriously underestimate the false positive rate.” Importantly, for both fingerprints and firearms analysis, the group writes that transforming the practice from a subjective one to an objective one is preferable, by automating the disciplines through “machine learning” image analysis.
Regarding footwear analysis — matching a shoe tread pattern left at a crime scene to a particular shoe based on “randomly acquired characteristics,” such as cuts and gouges on a shoe’s sole — the PCAST finds that there are no studies that demonstrate the practice is based on actual science. “Such conclusions are unsupported by any meaningful evidence or estimates of their accuracy and thus are not scientifically valid.”
And while PCAST finds that single-source and simple mixture DNA analysis rests firmly on a scientific foundation, the analysis of complex mixtures requires more validation. Complex mixtures involve DNA samples with two or more unknown sources and result in a profile that “superimposes multiple individual DNA profiles.” In such cases, an analyst has to visually inspect the results and make a subjective determination about whether a particular suspect is present in the sample. And that determination can become clouded by outside knowledge of the particular case at hand, the report notes. The creation of “probabilistic genotyping software” and the testing of such software would go a long way to curing the problem. (The PCAST report notes that there are problems associated with other forensic practices it has not reviewed — singling out cases of alleged arson and prosecutions based on shaken baby syndrome — that also “require urgent attention.”)
Predictably, reaction to the draft report by the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) was swift. On September 2 — the day after the PCAST reportedly voted to approve it — the group issued a press release blasting the PCAST — and, seemingly missing the point the PCAST is trying to make. “The forensic disciplines that the PCAST authors attack are (and have been) reliably used every day by investigators, prosecutors, and defense attorneys across the United States to aid in both exonerating the innocent and convicting the guilty,” the group wrote. “The PCAST position regarding the use of forensic science is scientifically irresponsible. Adopting any of their recommendations would have a devastating effect on the ability of law enforcement, prosecutors and the defense bar to fully investigate their cases, exclude innocent suspects, implicate the guilty and achieve true justice at trial.”
NDAA president Mike Ramos, the elected district attorney in San Bernardino County, California, said that the NDAA will “continue to serve the citizens of this great nation” in part by defending the criminal justice system “against those who would seek to undermine” it.
Notably, it was under Ramos’s leadership that Bill Richards was wrongfully convicted of his wife’s murder; his office tried Richards three times before finally getting a conviction, and did so only after the questionable bite-mark evidence was introduced. After the California Supreme Court in late May threw out that conviction, which it determined was based on junk science, Ramos’s office made it clear to defense attorneys that they would seek to try Richards again. Ultimately, Ramos’s office dismissed the case, and Richards was finally freed.
“As a man who lost his life behind the false science of bite marks, I feel the proposed action of eliminating its use in the courtroom is long overdue,” Richards wrote in an email to The Intercept. “The desire to … convict appears to blind experts who don’t consider that some defendants are innocent. No subjective ‘science’ should be used in any courtroom. The witch hunt mentality takes over and they find matches that are not there, sending innocent people to prison.”",Jordan Smith,2016-09-07,success

Trump, in a national-security focused Q&A with former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael Flynn, described the Iran-Iraq war in flippant terms, saying that the two countries would “fight fight fight. And then Saddam Hussein would do the gas. And somebody else would do something else. And they’d rest.”
Clinton, on the other hand, focused her remarks on issues like college affordability and small businesses.
Fox, CNN, and MSNBC responded by giving almost all of their attention to Trump.
The networks started carrying Trump’s remarks at around 2:15 p.m. ET. When Clinton started speaking at around 2:30, the networks relegated her to a small, muted stream in the lower right-hand corner (MSNBC briefly put both up side by side as they offered commentary):
“Let’s listen to just a little bit of this, to get the flavor of it,” Fox anchor Martha MacCallum said when turning to the feed of Trump’s remarks. Fox then stayed with Trump for 23 minutes, before switching to Clinton at 2:41 and carrying her uninterrupted for six minutes.
MSNBC carried Trump even longer, starting around the same time and going until 2:50 (35 minutes). It then switched from Clinton, who was on from 2:51 until the end of her remarks at 3:14 (23 minutes).
CNN, meanwhile, carried Trump from 2:15 to 2:42 (28 minutes) and Clinton from 2:42 to 2:50 (8 minutes).
Television news media has long seen Trump’s campaign as its bread and butter. “Go Donald! Keep getting out there!” CBS chief executive Les Moonves told an investor presentation last December. He followed up by saying that Trump “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS, that’s all I got to say.”

https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/inside-mind-james-clapper/,Inside the Mind of James Clapper,"I’m going to have a story published later today about a new document, but until then, this new interview with (and profile of) Director of National Intelligence James Clapper by the Daily Beast‘s Eli Lake is worth spending a few moments examining. Last week, Lake published one excerpt of his interview where Clapper admitted that the U.S. Government should have told the American people that the NSA was collecting their communications records: as pure a vindication of Edward Snowden’s choice as it gets, for obvious reasons. But there are several new, noteworthy revelations from this morning’s article:
Thanks to rogue contractor Edward Snowden, the machinations of the shadow bureaucracy Clapper heads have for the last eight months been exposed one news story at a time. Clapper is often the guy who has to call newspaper editors to tell them not to print stories that they usually publish anyway.
This process of pre-publication notice to the government of NSA stories has been wildly misreported in some places. I’ve long expressed contempt for this process where it results in the suppression of information that should be public; where it essentially elevates U.S. officials into publication partners by engaging in protracted “negotiations” with them over what can and cannot be published; and especially where it means news organizations knowingly allow government officials to lie by withholding the actual facts.
For all the NSA stories published over the last eight months all around the world, the U.S. government was notified prior to publication (usually very shortly prior) by the news organizations’ editors (never, to my knowledge, by the journalists, at least not by me). News organizations do this for two reasons.
The first is legal: the U.S. Government insists that the publication of classified information, especially that which relates to “communications intelligence”, is a felony (see 18 U.S § 798), so every media lawyer vehemently argues that allowing the government an opportunity to make the case for why something shouldn’t be published is necessary to show a lack of criminal intent, i.e., to avoid criminal prosecution even while publishing top secret documents; the other is journalistic: it makes sense that journalists making choices about what to publish and what to say about documents would want more, rather than less, information when deciding.
I can’t speak for what The Washington Post or New York Times have done, but for the NSA articles on which I’ve worked – at the Guardian and with more than a dozen media outlets around the world – the government has argued in most cases that the story and accompanying documents should not be published. And in almost every single case – 99% if not more – those arguments have been rejected in their entirety and the stories and documents were published anyway. In fact, for the dozens and dozens of stories and documents on which I’ve worked, I can only recall a single case where anything the government said resulted in anything being withheld that we had decided to publish, and that was a trivial aspect of one part of one document which, unbeknownst to us, could have revealed the identity of an NSA employee (the Guardian and New York Times, without my involvement, both withheld some details on their story about NSA/GCHQ compromising of encryption standards, though primarily – as I understand it – because publishing the handful of compromised standards we knew about would mislead people into believing the other compromised standards (the vast majority of which weren’t revealed by the documents) were safe).
In every single other case, the government’s arguments for non-publication were rejected, usually because they were vague and unpersuasive. So while it’s true that the government’s input has been permitted prior to publication – just as journalists seek the input of anyone about which they’re writing – Lake is correct that in most cases (in my experience, almost all) that official input demanding suppression was rejected, exactly as it should have been.
To this day the U.S. government doesn’t know the full extent of what Snowden revealed or whether more documents that have yet to be published in the press have made their way into the hands of Russian or Chinese intelligence agencies.
It’s been rather amazing to watch not only the standard roster of government-loyal American journalists, but also those who fancy themselves some sort of cynical critics, uncritically regurgitate the government’s evidence-free assertion that Snowden took and then gave to journalists 1.7 million documents. It amazes me because: (1) anyone at this point who is willing to equate evidence-free government assertions with Truth is drowning in some extreme levels of authoritarianism, by definition; and (2) the government clearly has no idea what Snowden took, as report after report has made crystal clear.
Covering nearly an entire wall of the waiting area outside Clapper’s office is a wooden relief sculpture dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. It contains a flag, a rendition of the constitutional assembly, and a copy of the document itself. It also has a plaque that reads, “What is the magic of the Constitution? The magic is how it states: We, the people. For the first time in history, government was about the people, not about the leader.”
Yes, that’s right: James Clapper has converted the wall outside of his office into a flamboyant homage to the very same U.S. Constitution that he vandalizes on a daily basis. That is the greatest act of either deliberately overt contempt for the public or pathological self-delusion since Barack Obama advocated a legalized system of “preventive detention” in 2009 while he stood in front of the U.S. Constitution at the National Archive. Someone may want to explain to Clapper that a primary impetus for that Constitution, and for the American Revolution generally, was hatred of the King’s “general warrants” whereby people could be subject to searches without a whiff of evidence of wrongdoing.
Clapper also acknowledges that the very human nature of the bureaucracy he controls virtually insures that more mass disclosures are inevitable. “In the end,” he says, “we will never ever be able to guarantee that there will not be an Edward Snowden or another Chelsea Manning because this is a large enterprise composed of human beings with all their idiosyncrasies.”
That is indeed true, and it’s good news: more Chelsea Mannings and Edward Snowdens are inevitable, and there is nothing the U.S. Government can do to stop them. That’s good news because it means government officials will have to operate on the assumption that what they do in the dark will become public (an excellent deterrent) and because that type of transparency is inherently healthy in a political culture where secrecy is rampant and the institutions designed to check it (Congress, the media, the federal judiciary) have all profoundly failed.
This also underscores why the U.S. Government has been so vindictive in trying to punish the likes of Manning and other whistleblowers. Since they have no means of preventing these sorts of leaks, their only hope is to create a climate of fear and intimidation: if you are thinking about exposing our bad acts, look at what we did to Chelsea Manning or Tom Drake and think twice. That’s why it’s been so vital – and, for the U.S. national security state, so devastating – that Edward Snowden has remained out of their grasp: rather than getting to parade him in front of the world in an orange jumpsuit and shackles, U.S. officials are forced to watch as he is hailed as an international hero, receives award after award, and participates freely in the debate he triggered. That, in turn, allows the template he used to be a positive one, one that will undoubtedly inspire future whistleblowers.
[Democratic Sen. Ron] Wyden in a statement told The Daily Beast, “It’s true that no one knows what is going through a witness’s head when they are sitting at the witness table, other than the witness himself. Unfortunately, over the past several years a number of senior officials have repeatedly made misleading and inaccurate statements about domestic surveillance at congressional hearings and in other public settings.”
The lie Clapper criminally told to the U.S. Senate in March, 2013 has received the bulk of attention, but as Wyden makes clear, NSA and other senior officials have been repeatedly lying about U.S. surveillance to the Congress, to courts, and in public over and over about all sorts of things. That’s what makes the slavish equating by the U.S. media of “unproven NSA claims” with “truth” so embarrassingly subservient and irrational. It’s also what makes the eagerness of American journalists to demand Snowden’s imprisonment – contrasted with their fear of doing the same for Clapper – such a powerful illustration of their true allegiances and function.
Others are less charitable. Last month Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian Republican from Kentucky, said if Snowden was to face justice, he should “share a jail cell with James Clapper” for lying to Congress.
“Well Senator Paul says I should get to know [Snowden] by being in the same prison cell with him, which I don’t think is a good idea,” Clapper told The Daily Beast last week. “Probably wouldn’t be in Mr. Snowden’s best interest.”
This statement – half creepy prison fantasy and half threat – is unsurprising. The need for U.S. officials to publicly express a desire for violence when it comes to Snowden has asserted itself over and over.
Recall how House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers and former CIA/NSA chief Mike Hayden “joked” at a hearing that Snowden should be put on the U.S. government’s “hit list” and murdered. Last month, BuzzFeed quoted several anonymous Pentagon and intelligence community officials as they laid out their fantasies for how they would like to murder Snowden (“Going back to his flat and he is casually poked by a passerby. He thinks nothing of it at the time starts to feel a little woozy and thinks it’s a parasite from the local water. He goes home very innocently and next thing you know he dies in the shower”). Former CIA chief James Woolsey said “he should be hanged by his neck until he is dead” if convicted of treason, while former UN Ambassador John Bolton revealed an even more detailed fantasy: “My view is that Snowden committed treason, he ought to be convicted of that, and then he ought to swing from a tall oak tree.”
Not only does this underscore the warped pathologies among the glorious leaders of America’s National Security State, but it also highlights the inanity of believing that these kinds of people can and should be trusted with invasive spying powers to be exercised in the dark.
The charges against his integrity bother Clapper. “I would rather not hear that or see that,” he said. “It’s tough on my family, I will tell you that. My son is a high school teacher and he has a tendency, or he is getting over it, to internalize a lot of this.” Those who know and have worked with Clapper also say it’s unfair to call him dishonest. Rhodes said President Obama values Clapper because “he’s a straight shooter who doesn’t put any spin on the ball.”
It’s hardly surprising that President Obama regards a proven liar as a “straight shooter”. That’s the same President who regards torture-and-rendition-advocating John Brennan as his high moral priest when deciding who should be put on his “kill list”.
But what’s remarkable here is the self-pity on display from Clapper. He’s gone around the country over the last month branding journalists as “accomplices” for the crime of reporting on the NSA without the slightest regard for the effects that this thuggish behavior has on those journalists, their families, and the news-gathering process.
But what’s even more amazing is that Clapper considers himself some sort of victim rather than what he is: the completely undeserving beneficiary of a system of “justice” in which ordinary and powerless people are imprisoned for trivial offenses at greater numbers than any other nation in the world, while those who wield political power, like him, are free to commit crimes without even losing their powerful jobs, let alone being prosecuted for them. James Clapper should look in the mirror every morning and be extremely grateful for the corrupted political system that has shielded him from the consequences of his crimes even as he tries to criminalize others for doing things that the U.S. Constitution guarantees them the right to do.
Instead, he sees himself as the victim. He has medals on his chest and an important national security state position. It is simply outrageous that some people suggest that he has no right to commit felonies, and it’s infuriating that his adult son has to hear some people (almost none in the media) suggest that his criminal conduct should have the same consequences as when ordinary citizens commit less serious crimes. That’s the refusal to accept any personal responsibility, the view of powerful U.S. officials that they are and must be entirely above the law, the obsessive self-regard, that more than anything else has destroyed Washington’s political culture.

Yesterday, the German paper Bild am Sonntag reported that after President Obama ordered the NSA to cease its eavesdropping on the communications of Chancellor Angela Merkel, they responded by increasing their surveillance of her closest ministers and advisers. Aside from providing yet another illustration of the out-of-control entitlement that drives the U.S. Surveillance State, note that the report is based on “a high-ranking NSA employee in Germany”, which means that this is yet another NSA source to come forward to disclose the agency’s once-secret acts.",Glenn Greenwald,2014-02-24,success

Tunahan Kuzu, a member of Parliament who was born in Turkey and co-founded the new multi-ethnic party, Denk, or Think, in 2014 to represent immigrants to the Netherlands, explained later that he intended the gesture as a sign that many in the Netherlands object to the abuse of Palestinian civilians living under Israeli military rule in the occupied territories.
Photographs and video of the incident showed Kuzu, who was wearing a Palestinian flag pin on his lapel, smile and nod as he was introduced to the Israeli leader but withdraw his right hand behind his back as Netanyahu extended his.

Netanyahu was greeted more warmly by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, but the Dutch leader made it clear that his government wants an immediate end to the building of Jewish-only settlements on the territory Israel seized in 1967, supports the labeling of Israeli exports produced in the occupied West Bank, and would not bar citizens of the Netherlands from taking part in the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against firms that aid Israel’s occupation.
In his remarks, Netanyahu said that “Israel is not only defending itself, Israel is also helping to defend Europe” from “radical Islamist terrorists.”
On the flight home, Netanyahu recorded a message for his social-media followers in which he said the incident showed the difference between “those who want peace and those who don’t.”

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/07/opm-spent-less-than-nearly-all-other-federal-agencies-on-cybersecurity/,OPM Spent Less Than Nearly All Other Federal Agencies on Cybersecurity,"The federal agency that stored, and lost, millions of current and former government employees’ sensitive files, fingerprints, and security clearances spent only a small fraction of what other federal agencies allocated for cybersecurity, according to a new report published by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday.
The Office of Personnel Management breach, announced last June, involved the personal data of over 20 million individuals and was described by a former NSA senior official as “crown-jewels material.” The report was the conclusion of a year-long investigation following the breach.
The personnel agency spent just $2 million in 2015 to prevent malicious cyber activity, while the Department of Agriculture doled out $39 million. The departments of Commerce, Education, and Labor also spent more in this area. Among the categories of cybersecurity spending delineated by the committee — preventing malicious cyber activity, detecting, analyzing, and mitigating intrusions, and shaping the cybersecurity environment — only the Small Business Administration spent as little as OPM (although Small Business Administration spent more overall on cybersecurity).
OPM responded by saying the report does not actively reflect the progress the agency has made since the hack, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, insisted the report was flawed, in part because it failed to place blame on or otherwise account for the contractors involved in the agency’s cybersecurity. Additionally, an entirely new agency, the National Background Investigations Bureau, will now be in charge of the security clearance process.
More money doesn’t necessarily mean better security, however. According to analysis from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University published in January 2015, the government invested more money in cybersecurity, but failed to stem the increasing flow of cyber breaches.
Yet for an agency tasked with protecting sensitive personnel data, it didn’t appear to invest much in making sure adversaries couldn’t access its databases. The breach, according to many national security officials, will take years to recover from.
“Despite this high value information maintained by OPM, the agency failed to prioritize cybersecurity,” wrote the authors of the report, including Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/07/paying-taxes-is-a-lot-better-than-phony-corporate-courage-apple/,"Paying Taxes Is a Lot Better Than Phony Corporate Courage, Apple","Every fall the internet and its resident tech mumblers congregate for The Apple Event, a quasi-pagan streaming-video rite in which Tim Cook boasts of just how much money his company is making (a lot) and just how much good it’s introducing to the world (this typically involves a new iPhone). This is merely annoying most years; but in 2016, when Apple is loudly, publicly denying its tax obligations around the world, it’s just gross.
Today’s iteration of the ritual, which spanned roughly two hours and included about five minutes of news, began with a rundown of some very large numbers: Apple’s streaming music service has over 17 million paying subscribers, its App Store has topped 140 billion downloads, and that store’s revenue is double that of its Google counterpart. After a brief preview of an upcoming Super Mario game for the iPhone, sure to be a revenue blockbuster, Cook segued into a spiel about the importance of education and the necessity of providing proper resources to students. His solution: a new version of iWork, Apple’s productivity software suite, that allows for multiple kids to edit the same document at the same time. It seems unlikely this will make a substantial difference in the quality of education for children around the world — particularly in countries where public schools are underfunded because companies like Apple deliberately avoid paying taxes.
Apple, despite (or more likely, because of) its recurring status as the most valuable company in the history of capitalism, funnels a huge portion of its profits overseas, particularly to Ireland, in order to avoid paying its fair share at home in the United States. This year, the company has come under fire from the EU for failing to pay what it should even in the zone where it’s stashing its profits — the European Commission has demanded a $15 billion payment from Apple over unpaid Irish taxes, a sum Ireland is actually refusing to accept for fear it will lose its coveted status as Apple’s unscrupulously convenient money dump. Meanwhile, the United States is condemning the EU’s ruling because it’s also battling Apple for unpaid taxes — it has apparently not occurred to either party that Apple is so unfathomably cash-rich that it could satisfy its tax obligations on two continents at once.
The official corporate position is now effectively We’ll pay what we want, and you’ll deal with it; Tim Cook himself has said Apple will only repatriate its vast billions to the U.S. if it’s at a rate he considers “fair.” Cook simultaneously claims Apple is already paying more in taxes than anyone else in the world, which as Bloomberg’s Shira Ovide puts it, “has the benefit of possibly being true and impossible to verify.”
Apple’s tax schemes cannot be dismissed as merely matching the competition for reasons of corporate pragmatism. Yes, Google and Facebook engage in aggressive tax avoidance too. But Cook appears to be pushing for permanently lower corporate taxes. That’s the best explanation for why he has helped raise money for Republican legislators despite sharp differences on social issues (Cook is the world’s most prominent gay executive). This seems like as good a point as any to mention that Cook today boasted that Apple has sold over a billion iPhones around the world — the iPhone 7 will retail for $649.
And so it’s hard to swallow Apple’s use of the word “courage” to describe the corporate ethos that pushed the company to remove the headphone plug from the newest iPhone while offering a new pair of jack-free earbuds that will run you $160. Removing a headphone jack or adding 20 headphone jacks does not require courage; engineers are very smart, but their job does not typically require much bravery. Courage is more often found in, say, running into a burning school to rescue the students and class rodent. Or, maybe, you could call courageous the act of paying the many billions you owe around the world into the system that ensures those students have all of the resources they need in order to learn and grow.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/07/google-program-to-deradicalize-jihadis-will-be-used-for-right-wing-american-extremists-next/,Google Program to Deradicalize Jihadis Will Be Used for Right-Wing American Extremists Next,"A Google-incubated program that has been targeting potential ISIS members with deradicalizing content will soon be used to target violent right-wing extremists in North America, a designer of the program said at an event at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday.
Using research and targeted advertising, the initiative by London-based startup Moonshot CVE and Google’s Jigsaw technology incubator targets potentially violent jihadis and directs them to a YouTube channel with videos that refute ISIS propaganda.
In the pilot program countering ISIS, the so-called Redirect Method collected the metadata of 320,000 individuals over the course of eight weeks, using 1,700 keywords, and served them advertisements that led them to the videos. Collectively, the targets watched more than half a million minutes of videos.
The event at Brookings was primarily about the existing program aimed at undermining ISIS recruiting. “I think this is an extremely promising method,” said Richard Stengel, U.S. undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
Ross Frenett, co-founder of Moonshot, said his company and Jigsaw are now working with funding from private groups, including the Gen Next Foundation, to target other violent extremists, including on the hard right.
“We are very conscious — as our own organization and I know Jigsaw are — that this [violent extremism] is not solely the problem of one particular group,” Frenett said.
“Our efforts during phase two, when we’re going to focus on the violent far right in America, will be very much focused on the small element of those that are violent. The interesting thing about how they behave is they’re a little bit more brazen online these days than ISIS fan boys,” Frenett said.
He noted that this new target demographic is more visible online.
“In the U.K., if someone in their Facebook profile picture has a swastika and is pointing a gun at the camera, that person is committing a crime,” Frenett said. “In the U.S., there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. So we found that when we’re looking for individuals that are genuinely at risk of carrying out violence, that they’re relatively open online.”
Adnan Kifayat, head of global security ventures at Gen Next Foundation, said he is optimistic about applying the ISIS approach to North America. “Our interest is in countering extremism … particularly in the homeland,” he told The Intercept.
Gen Next Foundation, based in Newport Beach, California, was founded by a group of young executives, authors, entrepreneurs, and others to fight terrorism.
In the ISIS pilot program, the YouTube channel pulls pre-existing videos that, according to Yasmin Green, the head of research and development for Jigsaw, “refute ISIS’s messaging.”
One video is from a woman who secretly filmed her life in ISIS-controlled Raqqa. Another shows young people in Mosul, their faces obscured by keffiyehs for their protection, talking about life under the Islamic State.
“The branding philosophy for the entire pilot project was not to appear judgmental or be moralistic, but really to pique interest of individuals who have questions, questions that are being raised and answered by the Islamic State,” Green said.
The next phase will also home in on changes in users’ behavior.
“The idea that you can’t measure consumption patterns online is frankly absurd,” Frenett said.",Naomi LaChance,2016-09-07,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/07/nbcs-military-forum-was-a-master-class-on-how-not-to-hold-candidates-accountable/,NBC’s Military Forum Was a Master Class on How Not to Hold Candidates Accountable,"The “Commander-in-Chief Forum” with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that NBC’s Matt Lauer moderated Wednesday night was billed as a way to interrogate the presidential candidates on substantive veterans’ and national security issues.
But from the questions chosen to the format, the event served as little more than a class on how not to hold the candidates accountable.
In the 25 minutes devoted to Clinton, nearly half was spent by Lauer grilling her about her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state (one veteran also asked about the issue). That left little room for questions on policies she presided over while in office.
Lauer repeatedly failed to fact-check candidates on their responses to questions. When Hillary Clinton explained her anti-ISIS plan by saying “we are not going to have ground troops in Iraq,” he failed to point out that we already do have those troops. When Donald Trump claimed to have opposed the wars in Iraq and Libya from the beginning, Lauer failed to correct him and tell the audience that wasn’t true.
The forum was co-sponsored with the veterans group the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), and some of the strongest questions came from veterans themselves — such as one question about how war veterans can trust a candidate with hawkish tendencies to end U.S. wars (Clinton) and another about how we can de-escalate tensions with Russia (Trump).
Unfortunately, those veterans received little airtime. Despite the fact that this is the only general election presidential forum so far focused exclusively on veterans’ and national security issues, NBC limited it to one hour. In that hour, a total of three minutes was spent taking questions from 10 questioners (four veterans asking questions of Clinton and six for Trump). The veterans were not allowed to ask follow-up questions or to offer any audible evaluation of the answers they elicited.
Lauer chose to ask Trump about his preparedness and past remarks, rather than question his actual plans. “I’d like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander in chief,” said Lauer. Lauer would go on to further question Trump about his “preparedness,” his “temperament,” and his receptiveness to intelligence briefings.
It was left to the veterans to ask Trump about how to defeat ISIS, how to bring stability to the Middle East, how to stop veteran suicides and sexual violence in the military, and whether undocumented immigrants can serve in the armed forces. Lauer offered no meaningful challenges to any of his answers.
Lauer could have challenged Trump on his previous proposals, like “bombing the shit out of ISIS,” or on how tonight’s suggestions — like “leave a certain group behind and take various sections where they have the oil” – were supposed to bring lasting peace to the Middle East. But he did not.
On Wednesday afternoon, just eight hours before the forum, Trump proposed a dramatic expansion in the size of the military, increasing the army from 475,000 active duty soldiers to 540,000 — roughly the amount deployed at the height of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars — and adding roughly 100 ships and fighter jets to the Navy and Air Force. But Trump did not explain how he intended to pay for those hundred-billion-dollar proposals, or even attempt to show how they would help defeat ISIS.
Lauer failed to raise many of the most controversial national security issues in the post-9/11 world. For Lauer, the issue was whether Clinton’s emails contained information on the covert drone program, not whether the covert drone program was legal or ethical. He never to pressed her about the surveillance implications of her “intelligence surge,” or what “working with experts in Silicon Valley” meant. Trump was never asked to defend his proposals to infiltrate American mosques and spy on predominantly Muslim neighborhoods. At no point was either candidate pressed for their stance on the drone war, torture, Guantánamo Bay, or mass surveillance.
“This forum was an absolute disgrace. Matt Lauer treated this forum less as a chance to educate voters about the real differences in temperament and policy between the candidates and more as a chance to do clickbait trolling. Instead of asking about big ideas, he asked small-bore questions that voters aren’t asking at their dinner tables,” Adam Green’s Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is pushing for a debate format where Americans generate and rank questions to be asked of the candidates, said in response to NBC’s forum.",Zaid Jilani; Alex Emmons,2016-09-07,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/06/a-base-britanica-da-nsa-no-coracao-do-programa-de-assassinatos-seletivos-dos-eua/,A base britânica da NSA no coração do programa de assassinatos seletivos dos EUA | Intercept Brasil,"As ruelas estreitas são calmas e tortuosas, cercadas por campos esverdeados e com raros sinais de vida, exceto os eventuais rebanhos de ovelhas. Mas, no horizonte, destacam-se estruturas que se assemelham a bolas de golfe gigantes, protegidas por uma grade perimetral coberta por arame farpado. Aqui, no coração da tranquila região campestre da Inglaterra, fica a maior base de espionagem no exterior da Agência de Segurança Nacional (NSA) dos EUA.
Anteriormente conhecida apenas pelo codinome Estação de campo 8613, a base secreta — agora conhecida como Estação Menwith Hill — fica localizada a nove quilômetros aos leste da pequena vila de Harrogate, no norte de Yorkshire. Originalmente destinada a monitorar as comunicações dos soviéticos durante a Guerra Fria, a estação teve seu foco drasticamente alterado e, hoje, é parte fundamental da rede de vigilância global em expansão da NSA.
Por muitos anos, jornalistas e pesquisadores especularam a respeito do que realmente se passaria dentro de Menwith Hill. Alguns políticos e grupos defensores dos direitos humanos fazem campanha por maior transparência nas atividades da estação. Contudo, o governo britânico sempre foi enfático ao se recusar a discutir as atividades da base, alegando a velha política de não comentar assuntos de segurança nacional.
Porém, os documentos confidenciais recentemente obtidos pelo The Intercept fornecem informações exclusivas sobre o que acontece por trás das grades de arame farpado de Menwith Hill. Os arquivos revelam pela primeira vez como a NSA usou a base britânica para auxiliar “um número considerável de operações de captura e extermínio” por todo o Oriente Médio e pelo norte da África, equipada com poderosas tecnologias de grampo que podem coletar dados na ordem de mais de 300 milhões de e-mails e chamadas telefônicas por dia.
Na última década, mostram os documentos, a NSA foi pioneira em programas de espionagem inovadores em Menwith Hill para identificar com precisão a localização de suspeitos de terrorismo acessando a internet nos cantos mais obscuros do planeta. Um dos programas, chamado Ghosthunter, apoiou operações militares convencionais britânicas e americanas no Iraque e no Afeganistão. Além disso, contribuiu para missões secretas em países aos quais os EUA não declararam guerra, incluindo um caso onde o programa ajudou uma equipe de operações especiais secretas a caçar um membro da Al Qaeda no Líbano. Os funcionários da NSA de Menwith Hill também colaboraram em um projeto que visava “eliminar” alvos terroristas no Iêmen, onde os EUA conduzem uma campanha de bombardeio por drone que resultou em dezenas de civis mortos.
As revelações sobre Menwith Hill levantam novas dúvidas a respeito da extensão da colaboração britânica nos ataques americanos através de drones e outras missões conhecidas como assassinatos seletivos, que podem ter violado leis internacionais e configurado crimes de guerra em alguns casos. Sucessivos governos britânicos declararam publicamente que todas as atividades na base foram realizadas com o “conhecimento e consentimento completo” dos oficiais britânicos.
As revelações representam “mais um exemplo do inaceitável nível de sigilo em torno da participação do Reino Unido no programa de “assassinatos seletivos” dos EUA”, contou Kat Craig, diretora jurídica do grupo de direitos humanos londrino Reprieve, ao The Intercept.
“Agora, é imperativo que o primeiro ministro seja franco a respeito do envolvimento do Reino Unido nos assassinatos seletivos”, disse Craig, “para garantir que funcionários e recursos britânicos não sejam afetados por atividades imorais e ilegais”.
O Ministro da Defesa do governo britânico, que lida com a assessoria de imprensa de Menwith Hill, se recusou a responder à reportagem.
A NSA enviou uma solicitação de declaração para o gabinete do Diretor de Inteligência Nacional.
Richard Kolko, porta-voz do DNI, disse em nota: “Os homens e mulheres que servem à comunidade de inteligência asseguram a segurança nacional dos EUA coletando informações, conduzindo análises e fornecendo inteligência para que decisões sejam tomadas com embasamento, de acordo com um conjunto de leis, políticas e diretrizes rigorosas”.
O equipamento em Menwith Hill encontra-se distribuído por 2,5 km2 de terras, vigiado 24 horas por dia pela Polícia Militar britânica e monitorado por câmeras de instaladas em postes que observam quase todas as seções da grade perimetral de 3m de altura.O detalhe que mais salta aos olhos é o aglomerado de aproximadamente 30 domos brancos gigantes. Além disso, as instalações também abrigam uma pequena comunidade completamente independente, acessível apenas àqueles com passes de segurança. Dentre os edifícios de operação onde os analistas escutam conversas monitoradas, há uma pista de boliche, uma sala de bilhar, um bar, um restaurante fastfood e uma loja de conveniências.
Grande parte das chamadas internacionais, do tráfego de internet, e-mails e outras formas de comunicação do mundo inteiro são enviados através de uma rede de cabos submarinos que conectam países como artérias gigantes. Em postos de espionagem por todo o mundo, a NSA e seus parceiros usam esses cabos para monitorar o fluxo de informações que passam por eles. Mas a base Menwith Hill se especializou em um tipo diferente de vigilância: interceptação de comunicações transmitidas pelo ar.
De acordo com os documentos confidenciais cedidos ao The Intercept por Edward Snowden, Menwith Hill tem dois recursos de espionagem de destaque. O primeiro é conhecido como Fornsat e usa uma antena poderosa, dentro de um dos domos em forma de bola de golfe, para interceptar comunicações enquanto estão sendo transmitidas por satélites estrangeiros. O segundo se chama Overhead e usa satélites do governo americano que orbitam o globo e sobrevoam países específicos para monitorar as comunicações sem fio, como chamadas de celular realizadas em chão firme, e para tirar fotos aéreas de áreas de interesse.
No final dos anos 80, as redes de comunicação internacionais foram revolucionadas por cabos submarinos de fibra ótica. A nova tecnologia era mais barata do que o uso de satélites e podia transmitir dados pelo globo muito mais rapidamente que antes, em velocidades próximas à velocidade da luz. Por esse motivo, de acordo com os documentos da NSA, na metade dos anos 90, a comunidade de inteligência dos EUA estava convencida de que as comunicações via satélite se tornariam obsoletas em pouco tempo e que deveriam ser substituídas por redes de cabo de fibra ótica.Mas tais previsões estavam erradas. E milhões de chamadas de telefone ainda são transmitidas via satélite, bem como grandes volumes de dados de internet, que a NSA tem explorado constantemente em Menwith Hill.
“O setor comercial de comunicações via satélite continua vivo e rentável, e transbordando de tráfego DNI (Digital Network Intelligence – Informações de redes digitais) em massa, cada vez mais sofisticado, em sua grande maioria sem criptografia”, conforme descreveu um documento de 2006 da NSA. “Essa única fonte de informações oferece mais dados a serem examinados pelos analistas de Menwith Hill do que encontrava-se disponível para toda a organização há muito pouco tempo.”
Os governos do Reino Unido e dos EUA enganaram seus cidadãos deliberadamente por anos usando uma “desculpa”.
Até 2009, a missão de vigilância de satélites estrangeiros de Menwith Hill, Moonpenny, monitorava 163 links de dados de satélite. As comunicações interceptadas eram canalizadas para uma grande variedade de repositórios que armazenavam chamadas telefônicas, mensagens de texto, e-mails, históricos de busca na internet e outros dados.
Não se sabe exatamente o volume de comunicações que Menwith Hill pode acessar por vez, mas os documentos da NSA indicam que o número é extremamente alto. Em um único período de 12 horas, em maio de 2011, por exemplo, os sistemas de vigilância registraram mais de 355 milhões de registros de metadados que revelam informações sobre tais comunicações — como remetente e destinatário de um e-mail ou números de telefone discados e horário da chamada realizada por alguém.
Com o objetivo de manter sob sigilo as informações sobre o papel de vigilância de Menwith Hill, os governos do Reino Unido e dos EUA enganaram seus cidadãos por anos usando uma “desculpa”, retratando a base como uma instalação destinada a fornecer “relés de rádio rápidos e conduzir pesquisas na área de comunicação”. Um documento confidencial do governo americano, datado de 2005, alertou funcionários de agências espiãs a respeito de deixarem escapar a verdade sobre a base. “É importante conhecer a desculpa adotada para a existência da MHS [Menwith Hill Station (Estação)] e esconder o fato de que a MHS é uma instalação de coleta de inteligência”, informava o documento. “Qualquer referência a satélites sendo operados ou relacionados a coleta de inteligência é estritamente proibida”.
O posto militar foi construído nos anos 50, como parte de um acordo entre os governos britânico e americano, com o intuito de abrigar funcionários americanos e equipamentos de vigilância para interceptar chamadas telefônicas. Em seus primeiros anos, a tecnologia existente em Menwith Hill era muito mais primitiva. De acordo com Kenneth Bird, que trabalhou na base nos 60, durante a Guerra Fria, a base se concentrava em monitorar as comunicações da Europa Ocidental. As conversas interceptadas eram gravadas em fitas Ampex, de acordo com o testemunho de Bird publicado em 1997, com algumas chamadas transcritas em tempo real por analistas em máquinas de escrever.
A base de Menwith Hill é um lugar muito diferente nos dias de hoje. Seus sistemas de espionagem são capazes de ingerir muito mais dados de comunicação, bem como tem um alcance geográfico muito mais amplo. Além disso, os objetos de vigilância mudaram drasticamente, assim como a finalidade dos grampos realizados.
Os documentos obtidos por The Intercept revelam que os satélites de espionagem usados em Menwith Hill atualmente podem interceptar comunicações na China e na América Latina, além de possibilitar uma “cobertura contínua da maioria do território da Eurásia”, onde interceptam “sinais estratégicos de comunicação militar, científica, política, técnica e econômica”. Mas talvez a função mais importante desempenhada pela base nos últimos anos tenha sido no Oriente Médio e no Norte da África.
Especialmente em partes remotas do planeta, onde não há links de cabos de fibra ótica, é comum que as conexões de internet e chamadas de telefone se deem via satélite. Por consequência, Menwith Hill se tornou uma base vital para a campanha antiterrorismo do governo dos EUA depois dos ataques de 11 de setembro. Desde então, a base tem sido usada de forma intensa para interceptar as comunicações de áreas menos acessíveis, onde sabe-se que grupos extremistas islâmicos, como al Qaeda e al Shabaab, operam — por exemplo, na região da fronteira entre Afeganistão e Paquistão, na Somália e no Iêmen.
Mais importante ainda é o fato de Menwith Hill ter sido usada para outras atividades, que não a coleta de inteligência de pessoas e governos de países do Oriente Médio e do Norte da África. Tais ferramentas de vigilância, como o sistema Ghosthunter, foram desenvolvidas com o objetivo único de auxiliar operações militares, precisando as localizações de pessoas ou grupos específicos para que fossem capturados ou assassinados.Os documentos revelados descrevem o Ghosthunter como meio de “localizar alvos quando entram na internet”. O sistema foi desenvolvido em 2006 como o “único recurso de seu tipo” e permitiu “um número representativo de operações de captura e extermínio” contra supostos terroristas. Apenas alguns exemplos específicos são oferecidos, mas esses casos dão exemplos notáveis do poder extraordinário da tecnologia.
Em um caso ocorrido em 2007, analistas de Menwith Hill usaram o Ghosthunter para localizar um “intermediário” no Líbano que era descrito como “altamente ativo” – ou seja, considerado um alvo legítimo para assassinato ou captura. A localização do alvo — que era conhecido por diversos nomes, inclusive Abu Sumayah — foi realizada com uma margem de erro de poucas centenas de metros, de acordo com as interceptações de suas comunicações. Em seguida, um satélite espacial tirou fotografias aéreas do bairro de Sidon, no sul do Líbano, onde acreditava-se que o indivíduo residia, mapeando as ruas e casas no entorno. Um documento altamente secreto com mais informações sobre a vigilância indica que a informação foi passada para uma unidade secreta de operações especiais, conhecida como Task Force 11-9, preparada para conduzir uma operação secreta para assassinar ou capturar Sumayah. No entanto, o resultado da operação é incerto, já que não foi revelado no documento.
Em outro caso, em 2007, o Ghosthunter foi usado para identificar um suposto “comprador de armas” da al Qaeda no Iraque, chamado Abu Sayf. Os sistemas de vigilância da NSA localizaram Sayf quando entrava em contas de e-mail e bate-papo do Yahoo em um café próximo a uma mesquita em Anah, uma cidade à beira do Rio Euphrates, que fica 320 quilômetros ao noroeste de Bagdá. Os analistas em Menwith Hill usaram o Ghosthunter para precisar sua localização e satélites de espionagem operados na base britânica para capturar imagens aéreas. Essas informações foram repassadas às tropas americanas em Fallujah para serem incluídas em um “plano de ataque”.
Alguns dias depois, uma unidade de operações especiais, a Task Force-16, invadiu duas propriedades, onde detiveram Sayf, seu pai, dois irmãos e cinco companheiros.
Em 2008, a popularidade aparente do Ghosthunter na comunidade de inteligência resultou em sua implementação em outras bases de vigilância com presença da NSA, incluindo Ayios Nikolaos, no Chipre, e Misawa, no Japão. A distribuição da ferramenta para outras bases representou um alcance “praticamente global”. Mas Menwith Hill permaneceu sendo sua base mais representativa. “[Menwith Hill] ainda fornece aproximadamente 99% dos dados Fornsat usados em localizações geográficas do Ghosthunter”, confirmou um documento de janeiro de 2008 sobre o programa.
Um documento de 2009 acrescentou que o objetivo principal do Ghosthunter, à época, envolvia “a localização geográfica de cibercafés na região do Oriente Médio/África do Norte em apoio às operações militares dos EUA” e dizia que tinha, até o momento, “localizado geograficamente mais de 5 mil terminais VSAT no Iraque, Afeganistão, Síria, Líbano e Irã. VSAT, Very Small Aperture Terminal (Terminal de Abertura Muito Pequena), é um sistema de satélites usado comumente por cibercafés e governos estrangeiros para enviar e receber comunicações e dados. O Ghosthunter também podia atacar VSATs no Paquistão, Somália, Argélia, Filipinas, Mali, Quênia e Sudão de acordo com os documentos.
A capacidade exclusiva a Menwith Hill de rastrear satélites em qualquer lugar do planeta, por vezes, colocou-o na linha de frente de conflito a milhares de quilômetros de distância. No Afeganistão, por exemplo, analistas da base usaram a vigilância VSAT para rastrear membros suspeitos do Talibã, resultando em “aproximadamente 30 inimigos assassinados” durante uma série de ataques mencionados em um relatório top-secret de julho de 2011. No começo de 2012, analistas da base foram solicitados a rastrear um VSAT: desta vez, para auxiliar as forças especiais na província de Helmand, no Afeganistão. A localização do terminal foi rápida e, em menos de uma hora, um drone MQ-9 Reaper foi enviado para a área para iniciar um ataque aéreo, ao que tudo indica.
Mas o uso letal de dados de vigilância não parece ter sido restrito a áreas de guerra convencionais, como o Afeganistão ou o Iraque. A NSA desenvolveu métodos semelhantes em Menwith Hill para rastrear suspeitos de terrorismo no Iêmen, onde os EUA haviam iniciado ataques secretos com drones contra militantes associados a al Qaeda na península norte.
No começo de 2010, a agência revelou em um relatório interno que tinha inaugurado uma técnica nova na base britânica para identificar diversos alvos “em quase 40 cibercafés localizados em pontos geográficos distintos” na província de Shabwah, no Iêmen, e na capital do país. A técnica, de acordo com o documento, era vinculada a uma iniciativa secreta mais ampla, chamada Ghostwolf, descrita como um projeto para “capturar ou eliminar nós cruciais em redes terroristas”, concentrando-se primordialmente em “fornecer dados de localização geográfica obtidos através de [vigilância] de clientes e de seus componentes operacionais”.
A descrição do Ghostwolf vincula Menwith Hill a operações letais no Iêmen, fornecendo as primeiras provas documentais que implicam o Reino Unido diretamente em relação às operações secretas no país.
A dimensão da evidente cumplicidade do governo britânico em controversos ataques dos EUA foi realçada pelo papel anteriormente desconhecido da base militar de Menwith Hill no assassinato seletivo de suspeitos de terrorismo, suscitando dúvidas sobre a legalidade das operações secretas realizadas a partir da base.
Há cerca de 1.800 funcionários em Menwith Hill, a maioria americanos. Além dos funcionários da NSA no complexo, o National Reconnaissance Office (NRO – Departamento de Reconhecimento Nacional) também tem uma presença importante no local, operando sua própria “estação terrestre”, a partir da qual controla diversos satélites de espionagem.
No entanto, foi apenas em 2014 que o governo britânico assumiu publicamente que as operações na base “sempre foram, e continuam sendo” executadas com seu “conhecimento e consentimento”. Além disso, aproximadamente 500 dos funcionários nas instalações pertencem a agências do Reino Unido, incluindo funcionários do organismo britânico homólogo da NSA, o Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ – Quartel-general de Comunicação do Governo britânico).
Há vários anos que ativistas e legisladores na área dos direitos humanos pressionam o governo no sentido de fornecer informações sobre seu envolvimento nas operações americanas de assassinato seletivo, contudo, a única resposta até agora foi o silêncio. Mais especificamente, houve uma tentativa de determinar se o Reino Unido teria ajudado nos bombardeios com drones dos EUA fora de zonas de guerra declaradas, incluindo em países como Iêmen, Paquistão e Somália, que resultaram na morte de centenas de civis e foram, em alguns casos, considerados por funcionários das Nações Unidas como possíveis crimes de guerra e violações da lei internacional.
Apesar de indicarem que Menwith Hill ajudou “em um número considerável” de operações de “captura e assassinato”, os documentos de Snowden analisados pelo The Intercept não revelam detalhes específicos sobre todos os incidentes que resultaram em vítimas mortais. No entanto, ficou claro que a base teve como alvos países como o Iêmen, Paquistão e Somália, incluídos em programas de rastreamento de localização como o Ghosthunter e Ghostwolf, criados para ajudar a identificar indivíduos a serem capturados ou assassinados, sugerindo uma participação nos ataques com drones nesses países.
“Um indivíduo envolvido com a passagem dessas informações pode ser considerado cúmplice de um homicídio.”
Craig, diretora jurídica da Reprieve, analisou os documentos de Menwith Hill, concluindo que indicavam a cumplicidade britânica nos ataques com drones secretos dos EUA. “Há anos que a Reprieve e outras entidades procuram obter explicações do governo britânico sobre o papel das bases britânicas no programa secreto de drones dos EUA, responsável pela morte de elevados números de civis em países com os quais não estamos em guerra”, ela contou ao The Intercept. “Nos enganaram com truísmos e nos asseguraram que todas as atividades dos EUA em bases britânicas, ou com o envolvimento das mesmas, estavam em total conformidade com as disposições jurídicas nacionais e internacionais. Agora, parece que nada disso era verdade”.
Jemima Stratford, advogada britânica de direitos humanos, disse ao The Intercept que existem “perguntas sérias a serem feitas e argumentos sérios a estabelecer” sobre a legalidade das operações letais conduzidas com a assistência de Menwith Hill. As operações, afirmou Stratford, podem ter violado a Convenção Europeia dos Direitos Humanos, um tratado internacional ao qual o Reino Unido continua vinculado, apesar do voto recente pela saída da União Europeia. O Artigo 2 da Convenção protege o “direito à vida” e declara que “ninguém pode ser privado da vida intencionalmente”, exceto se tal for ordenado por um tribunal, como pena a ser aplicada por um crime.
Stratford havia alertado anteriormente que funcionários britânicos podem ser implicados em homicídio caso tenham facilitado ataques com drones dos EUA fora de zonas de guerra declaradas. Em 2014, ela aconselhou os membros do parlamento britânico para o fato dos EUA não estarem em guerra com países como o Iêmen ou Paquistão e, portanto, no âmbito da lei inglesa e internacional, os indivíduos assassinados por drones nesses países não constituíam “combatentes”, nem seus assassinos eram beneficiados pela “imunidade de combatente”.
“Se o governo britânico tiver conhecimento da transferência de dados que podem ser usados em ataques por drones contra não combatentes (…) essa transferência provavelmente é ilegal”, disse Stratford aos membros do parlamento. “Um indivíduo envolvido na transmissão dessas informações é, provavelmente, cúmplice de homicídio.”
O GCHQ se recusou a responder perguntas da reportagem, citando uma “velha política da agência que define que não comentamos a respeito de questões de inteligência”. Um porta-voz da agência publicou uma nota genérica declarando que “todo o trabalho do GCHQ é realizado de acordo com fundamentos jurídicos e de política rigorosos, que garantem que nossas atividades são autorizadas, necessárias e proporcionais, e que seguem uma supervisão rigorosa”. O porta-voz insistiu que o “regime de interceptação do Reino Unido é inteiramente compatível com a Convenção Europeia de Direitos Humanos”.
Em fevereiro de 2014, o departamento de Defesa dos EUA, depois de uma revisão de procedimento, anunciou que planejava reduzir o número de funcionários em Menwith Hill em 2016, com cortes estimados em 500 militares e civis. Um porta-voz da Força Aérea dos EUA contou ao jornal militar Stars and Strips que a decisão foi baseada em avanços tecnológicos, dos quais se recusou falar, apesar de mencionar expansão na “capacidade dos servidores que estamos usando; estamos fazendo mais com menos hardware”.
Os documentos fornecidos por Snowden esclarecem algumas das alterações tecnológicas específicas. Mais especificamente, mostram que houve um investimento considerável em introduzir sistemas de vigilância em massa mais sofisticados em Menwith Hill nos últimos anos. Em 2008, o então Diretor da NSA, Keith Alexander, introduziu uma mudança de direção nas políticas da agência. Em uma visita a Menwith Hill em junho daquele ano, Alexander desafiou os funcionários da base. “Por que não podemos coletar todos os sinais, o tempo inteiro?” disse o diretor, de acordo com os documentos da NSA. “Soa como um belo trabalho de casa para Menwith”.
Em decorrência disso, uma nova “postura de coleta” foi introduzida na base com o objetivo de “coletar tudo, processar tudo e explorar tudo”. Em outras palavras, a base deveria ingerir o máximo de comunicações que sua capacidade tecnológica permitisse.
Entre 2009 e 2012, mais de US$ 40 milhões foram gastos em Menwith Hill para construir um novo prédio de operações com 9.000 m2 — uma área equivalente a dois campos de futebol americano. Grande parte desse espaço — aproximadamente 1.000 m2 — foram reservados para um centro de dados que contava com a capacidade de armazenar quantidades enormes de comunicações interceptadas. Durante a reforma, a NSA enviou nossos sistemas de computadores e instalou 300 km de cabos, extensão suficiente para conectar Nova York a Boston. A agência também construiu um auditório com capacidade para 200 pessoas destinado a realização de reuniões sobre operações secretas e outros eventos.
“Como podemos autorizar operações em Menwith sobre as quais não podemos prestar contas ao público?”
Parte do enorme trabalho de expansão podia ser notado da rua no entorno do complexo de segurança, resultando em protestos de um grupo de ativistas locais chamado Campanha de Responsabilização das Bases Americanas. Desde o começo dos anos 90, o grupo monitora de perto as atividades em Menwith Hill. Há 12 anos, seus membros realizam um pequeno protesto toda terça-feira na entrada principal da base militar, saudando funcionários da NSA com bandeiras e banners com inscrições críticas à política internacional e os ataques por drones realizados pelos EUA.
Fabian Hamilton, representante da cidade de Leeds no parlamento britânico, se tornou um apoiador da campanha, ocasionalmente participando de eventos organizados pelo grupo e defendendo mais transparência em Menwith Hill. Hamilton, que representa o Partido Trabalhista, tem sido insistente em obter mais informações e, desde 2010, dirigiu mais de 40 perguntas formais ao governo no parlamento britânico sobre as atividades realizadas na base. O parlamentar buscou esclarecimento em diversas questões, como por exemplo, quantos funcionários encontram-se registrados nas instalações, se a base está envolvida na condução de ataques por drones e se os membros do comitê parlamentar de supervisão recebeu acesso completo à base para analisar suas operações. Mas seus esforços foram continuamente frustrados por agentes britânicos que se recusam a oferecer mais detalhes alegando motivos de segurança nacional.
Hamilton disse ao The Intercept que considerava “ofensivo” o sigilo em torno de Menwith Hill. As revelações sobre o papel desempenhado pela base nas operações de assassinato e captura dos EUA, contou, provou que uma reavaliação completa de suas operações se faz necessária. “Qualquer nação que usa suas forças militares para atacar um inimigo, seja um terrorista ou não, seja legítima ou não, tem de prestar contas a seus eleitores”, contou Hamilton. “Esse é um princípio fundamental de nosso parlamento, é a base de todo nosso sistema democrático. Como podemos autorizar operações em Menwith sobre as quais não podemos prestar contas ao público? Eu não compro essa ideia de que você diz a palavra “segurança” e ninguém pode saber de nada. Precisamos saber o que está sendo feito em nosso nome.

Quando o assunto é a ascensão da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa é uma preocupação só para anos eleitorais. Mas o projeto de poder bolsonarista nunca dorme.
A grande mídia, o agro, as forças armadas, as megaigrejas e as big techs bilionárias ganharam força nas eleições municipais — e têm uma vantagem enorme para 2026.
Não podemos ficar alheios enquanto somos arrastados para o retrocesso, afogados em fumaça tóxica e privados de direitos básicos. Já passou da hora de agir. Juntos.
A meta ousada do Intercept para 2025 é nada menos que derrotar o golpe em andamento antes que ele conclua sua missão. Para isso, dependemos do apoio de nossos leitores.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/08/documents-show-u-s-military-expands-reach-of-special-operations-programs/,Documents Show U.S. Military Expands Reach of Special Operations Programs,"The United States is spending more money on more missions to send more elite U.S. forces to train alongside more foreign counterparts in more countries around the world, according to documents obtained by The Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act.
Under the Joint Combined Exchange Training program, which is designed to train America’s special operators in a variety of missions — from “foreign internal defense” to “unconventional warfare” — U.S. troops carried out approximately one mission every two days in 2014, the latest year covered by the recently released documents.
At a price tag of more than $56 million, the U.S. sent its most elite operators — Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets, and others — on 176 individual JCETs, a 13 percent increase from 2013. The number of countries involved jumped even further, from 63 to 87, a 38 percent spike.
The JCET program is a key facet of a global strategy involving America’s most secretive and least scrutinized troops. Since 9/11, special operations forces (SOF) have expanded in almost every conceivable way — from budget to personnel to overseas missions. On any given day, 10,000 special operators are deployed or “forward stationed,” conducting missions that vary “from behind-the-scenes information-gathering and partner-building to high-end dynamic strike operations,” then-chief of U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year.
In 2014, more than 4,800 elite troops took part in JCETs, compared to just over 3,800 the year before. “The purpose of JCETs is to foster the training of U.S. SOF in mission-critical skills by training with partner-nation forces in their home countries,” Ken McGraw, a spokesperson for U.S. Special Operations Command, told The Intercept. “JCETs allow U.S. SOF to use and further develop their language skills and cultural knowledge plus hone their skills training indigenous forces.”
Gen. Raymond A. Thomas III, who is Votel’s successor as head of SOCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that “working with our international partners allows us to share the burden more appropriately. We must engage, not only where problems occur, but also in places critical to our vital national interests where no visible threat currently exists.”
The recently released documents note that, in addition to the training opportunities afforded to elite U.S. troops, the JCET program also provides “incidental benefits,” namely building military-to-military contacts, improving interoperability with foreign forces, and “gaining regional access with a minimal footprint.” The files further refer to JCETs as “low signature” missions.
A 2015 investigation by The Intercept revealed JCETs were regularly conducted with foreign militaries implicated by the U.S. State Department in gross human rights violations. And a more recent effort by The Intercept and 100Reporters found JCETs formed one facet of a global training network typified by a lack of coherent strategy and effective oversight.
A 2013 Rand Corp. study of JCETs conducted in areas covered by Africa Command, Pacific Command, and Southern Command found “moderately low” effectiveness of the missions in all three regions. Asked for comment on the findings, McGraw of SOCOM had little to say. “I have not and do not have the time to review the Rand study,” he told The Intercept, noting that he was aware of no one at the command who had read Rand’s analysis. “We are not going to comment on the study.”",Nick Turse,2016-09-08,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/08/obama-promises-lame-duck-tpp-push-despite-uproar-over-pro-corporate-provisions/,Obama Promises Lame-Duck TPP Push Despite Uproar Over Pro-Corporate Provisions,"A provision that would let foreign corporations challenge new American laws and regulations has become the latest flashpoint in the battle over the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, even as President Obama on Tuesday said he will renew his push for its passage in the lame-duck session of Congress.
“We’re in a political season now and it’s always difficult to get things done,” Obama said at a town hall meeting in Laos. “So after the election, I think people can refocus attention on why this is so important.” He sounded confident: “I believe that we’ll get it done.”
The latest salvo from opponents of the deal came in the form of a letter to Congress signed by hundreds of law professors and economists – including Laurence Tribe, who taught Obama at Harvard – protesting the inclusion of “Investor State Dispute Settlement” (ISDS) provisions in the TPP agreement.
The ISDS provisions would empower corporations who object to U.S. laws and regulations that cut into their profits to sue the United States before an international arbitration panel. The signatories to the letter write that this “system undermines the important roles of our domestic and democratic institutions, threatens domestic sovereignty, and weakens the rule of law.”
Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a leading critic of the ISDS provisions, introduced the letter on a conference call hosted Wednesday by the advocacy group Public Citizen.
“It’s about leverage,” Warren said. “Leverage for big companies to threaten an intimidate governments who might dare take action that threatens their profits.”
She cited the example of Canada being successfully sued under ISDS rules contained in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by a U.S.-based company that was denied a permit for an open-pit mining project.
Listen to the call:
The Obama administration has pushed back at critics of the ISDS provisions, saying that it is a routine system that exists in thousands of other international agreements, including 50 that the United States is currently a party to.
But that routine system has undermined domestic laws in some countries.
Buzzfeed’s Chris Hamby recently reviewed dozens of ISDS rulings, documenting how corporations used these international arbitration panels to avoid the reach of domestic courts.
For instance, following the ouster of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, the country sentenced Dubai-based real estate mogul Hussain Sajwani to five years in prison for corruption charges related to a sweetheart land deal between his company Damac Properties and the country’s Mubarak-era tourism minister.
Within a week of his conviction, Damac decided to sue Egypt using the World Bank’s arbitration process – arguing that because the previous regime had agreed to the terms, the deal was not criminal.
As Sajwani enlisted the help of some of the world’s top ISDS lawyers to argue his case in a court in Paris, Egypt decided to settle. The terms of the settlement are confidential, but we do know that Sajwani’s prison sentence was completely eliminated.
That set a precedent for a wave of ISDS claims. More and more firms used the ISDS process to avoid penalties handed down from Egypt’s courts.
Under the TPP, the U.S. would be exposed to a larger number of potential ISDS claims.
“If these provisions are included in TPP, the number of foreign investors who’d be empowered to use this mechanism would double from what we currently have in our 50 agreements already,” said Melinda St. Louis, international campaigns director at Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.
In all, Public Citizen estimates that passage of the TPP would newly empower over 10,000 U.S. subsidiaries owned by foreign corporations to launch investor-state cases against the American government.
Corporations from six countries that do not currently have the ability to bring ISDS claims against the United States — Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei – would gain that right under the TPP.
As The Intercept has previously reported, banks and other financial institutions would be able to use TPP provisions to sue over virtually any change in financial regulations affecting future profits in an extra-judicial tribunal.
The United States has not yet lost an ISDS case, but is facing a major claim from TransCanada. The company is using arbitration under NAFTA to seek $15 billion after the Obama Administration decided not to approve its Keystone XL Pipeline project.",Zaid Jilani,2016-09-08,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/08/hillary-clintons-national-security-advisors-are-a-whos-who-of-the-warfare-state/,"Hillary Clinton’s National Security Advisers Are a “Who’s Who"" of the Warfare State","Hillary Clinton is meeting on Friday with a new national security “working group” that is filled with an elite “who’s who” of the military-industrial complex and the security deep state.
The list of key advisers — which includes the general who executed the troop surge in Iraq and a former Bush homeland security chief turned terror profiteer — is a strong indicator that Clinton’s national security policy will not threaten the post-9/11 national-security status quo that includes active use of military power abroad and heightened security measures at home.
It’s a story we’ve seen before in President Obama’s early appointments. In retrospect, analysts have pointed to the continuity in national security and intelligence advisers as an early sign that despite his campaign rhetoric Obama would end up building on — rather than tearing down — the often-extralegal, Bush-Cheney counterterror regime. For instance, while Obama promised in 2008 to reform the NSA, its director was kept on and its reach continued to grow.
Obama’s most fateful decision may have been choosing former National Counterterrorism Center Director John Brennan to be national security adviser, despite Brennan’s support of Bush’s torture program. Brennan would go on to run the president’s drone program, lead the CIA, fight the Senate’s torture investigation, and then lie about searching Senate computers.
That backdrop is what makes Clinton’s new list of advisers so significant.
It includes Gen. David Petraeus, the major architect of the 2007 Iraq War troop surge, which brought 30,000 more troops to Iraq. Picking him indicates at partiality to combative ideology. It also represents a return to good standing for the general after he pled guilty to leaking notebooks full of classified information to his lover, Paula Broadwell, and got off with two years of probation and a fine. Petraeus currently works at the investment firm KKR & Co.
Another notable member of Clinton’s group is Michael Chertoff, a hardliner who served as President George W. Bush’s last secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and who since leaving government in 2009 has helmed a corporate consulting firm called the Chertoff Group that promotes security-industry priorities. For example, in 2010, he gave dozens of media interviews touting full-body scanners at airports while his firm was employed by a company that produced body scanning machines. His firm also employs a number of other ex-security state officials, such as former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden. It does not disclose a complete list of its clients — all of whom now have a line of access to Clinton.
Many others on the list are open advocates of military escalation overseas. Mike Morell, the former acting director of the CIA, endorsed Clinton last month in a New York Times opinion piece that accused Trump of being an “unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.” The Times was criticized for not disclosing his current employment by Beacon Global Strategies, a politically powerful national-security consulting firm with strong links to Clinton. Three days later, Morell told Charlie Rose in a PBS interview that the CIA should actively assassinate Russians and Iranians in Syria.
During his time at the CIA, Morell was connected to some of the worst scandals and intelligence failures of the Bush administration. In his book, he apologizes for giving flawed intelligence to Colin Powell about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction, but defends the CIA torture program as legal and ethical.
Jim Stavridis, a former NATO supreme allied commander Europe on Clinton’s advisory group, told Fox News Radio in July, when he was being vetted by Clinton as a possible vice presidential nominee, that “we have got to get more aggressive going into Syria and Iraq and go after [ISIS] because if we don’t they’re going to come to us. It’s a pretty simple equation.” He said he would “encourage the president to take a more aggressive stance against Iran, to increase our military forces in Iraq and Syria, and to confront Vladmir Putin” over his moves in Crimea.
The New York Times reported in 2011 that Michael Vickers, a former Pentagon official on Clinton’s new list, led the use of drone strikes. He would grin and tell his colleagues at meetings, “I just want to kill those guys.”
Others on the list played a role in the targeted killing policies of the Obama administration, including Chris Fussell, a top aide to Gen. Stanley McChrystal, and now a partner with him at his lucrative consulting firm, the McChrystal Group.
Fussell was aide-de-camp to McChrystal while he was serving as commander of Joint Special Operations Command. McChrystal oversaw a dramatic expansion in the use of night raids and assassinations, and would later be accused of condoning torture at JSOC’s Iraq Base, Camp NAMA (code for Nasty-Ass Military Area).
Richard Fontaine, a former McCain adviser and president of the counterinsurgency-focused think tank Center for a New American Security, responded to the Paris attacks by writing an op-ed that advocated, among other things, a U.S.-backed “safe zone” in Syria. He has also proposed intensifying the bombing campaign against ISIS, and increasing the presence of U.S. special forces in Iraq.
Janet Napolitano, a former Obama DHS secretary, presided over a harsh immigration policy, where the department deported a record number of undocumented immigrants — although she did support Obama’s recent executive actions designed to protect some migrants.
The closest thing the list has to a dissenter to the status quo would appear to be Kathleen Hicks, a think tanker who served in the Obama Defense Department. On a panel at the Charles Koch Institute with John Mearsheimer earlier this year, she denounced American military overreach. “A big footprint in the Middle East is not helpful to the United States, politically, militarily, or otherwise,” she said.
Despite the heavy relevance of the region to U.S. foreign policy, only one adviser, former DHS official Juliette Kayyem, is a (non-Muslim) Arab American.",Zaid Jilani; Alex Emmons; Naomi LaChance,2016-09-08,success

It also represents a return to good standing for the general after he pled guilty to leaking notebooks full of classified information to his lover, Paula Broadwell, and got off with two years of probation and a fine. Petraeus currently works at the investment firm KKR & Co.
Another notable member of Clinton’s group is Michael Chertoff, a hardliner who served as President George W. Bush’s last secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and who since leaving government in 2009 has helmed a corporate consulting firm called the Chertoff Group that promotes security-industry priorities. For example, in 2010, he gave dozens of media interviews touting full-body scanners at airports while his firm was employed by a company that produced body scanning machines. His firm also employs a number of other ex-security state officials, such as former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden. It does not disclose a complete list of its clients — all of whom now have a line of access to Clinton.
Many others on the list are open advocates of military escalation overseas. Mike Morell, the former acting director of the CIA, endorsed Clinton last month in a New York Times opinion piece that accused Trump of being an “unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.” The Times was criticized for not disclosing his current employment by Beacon Global Strategies, a politically powerful national-security consulting firm with strong links to Clinton. Three days later, Morell told Charlie Rose in a PBS interview that the CIA should actively assassinate Russians and Iranians in Syria.
During his time at the CIA, Morell was connected to some of the worst scandals and intelligence failures of the Bush administration. In his book, he apologizes for giving flawed intelligence to Colin Powell about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction, but defends the CIA torture program as legal and ethical.
Jim Stavridis, a former NATO supreme allied commander Europe on Clinton’s advisory group, told Fox News Radio in July, when he was being vetted by Clinton as a possible vice presidential nominee, that “we have got to get more aggressive going into Syria and Iraq and go after [ISIS] because if we don’t they’re going to come to us. It’s a pretty simple equation.” He said he would “encourage the president to take a more aggressive stance against Iran, to increase our military forces in Iraq and Syria, and to confront Vladmir Putin” over his moves in Crimea.
The New York Times reported in 2011 that Michael Vickers, a former Pentagon official on Clinton’s new list, led the use of drone strikes. He would grin and tell his colleagues at meetings, “I just want to kill those guys.”
Others on the list played a role in the targeted killing policies of the Obama administration, including Chris Fussell, a top aide to Gen. Stanley McChrystal, and now a partner with him at his lucrative consulting firm, the McChrystal Group.
Fussell was aide-de-camp to McChrystal while he was serving as commander of Joint Special Operations Command. McChrystal oversaw a dramatic expansion in the use of night raids and assassinations, and would later be accused of condoning torture at JSOC’s Iraq Base, Camp NAMA (code for Nasty-Ass Military Area).
Richard Fontaine, a former McCain adviser and president of the counterinsurgency-focused think tank Center for a New American Security, responded to the Paris attacks by writing an op-ed that advocated, among other things, a U.S.-backed “safe zone” in Syria. He has also proposed intensifying the bombing campaign against ISIS, and increasing the presence of U.S. special forces in Iraq.
Janet Napolitano, a former Obama DHS secretary, presided over a harsh immigration policy, where the department deported a record number of undocumented immigrants — although she did support Obama’s recent executive actions designed to protect some migrants.
The closest thing the list has to a dissenter to the status quo would appear to be Kathleen Hicks, a think tanker who served in the Obama Defense Department. On a panel at the Charles Koch Institute with John Mearsheimer earlier this year, she denounced American military overreach. “A big footprint in the Middle East is not helpful to the United States, politically, militarily, or otherwise,” she said.
Despite the heavy relevance of the region to U.S. foreign policy, only one adviser, former DHS official Juliette Kayyem, is a (non-Muslim) Arab American.",Zaid Jilani; Alex Emmons; Naomi LaChance,2016-09-08,success

Rand Paul’s expression of opposition to a $1.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia — which has been brutally bombing civilian targets in Yemen using U.S.-made weapons for more than a year now — alarmed CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday afternoon.
Blitzer’s concern: That stopping the sale could result in fewer jobs for arms manufacturers.
“So for you this is a moral issue,” he told Paul during the Kentucky Republican’s appearance on CNN. “Because you know, there’s a lot of jobs at stake. Certainly if a lot of these defense contractors stop selling war planes, other sophisticated equipment to Saudi Arabia, there’s going to be a significant loss of jobs, of revenue here in the United States. That’s secondary from your standpoint?”
Paul stayed on message. “Well not only is it a moral question, its a constitutional question,” Paul said. “Our founding fathers very directly and specifically did not give the president the power to go to war. They gave it to Congress. So Congress needs to step up and this is what I’m doing.”
Watch the exchange:
Saudi Arabia began bombing Yemen in March 2015, and has since been responsible for the majority of the 10,000 deaths in the war so far. The U.S.-backed bombing coalition has been accused of intentionally targeting civilians, hospitals, factories, markets, schools, and homes. The situation is so bad that the Red Cross has started donating morgue units to Yemeni hospitals.
The war’s incredible humanitarian toll has generated an increasing outcry in the United States. Earlier this month, more than 60 members of Congress signed a letter asking the administration to delay the most recent arms shipment. Ordinarily, under the Arms Export Control Act, Congress has 30 days to block arms sales proposed by the administration — but by announcing the arms sale in August, most of those 30 days fell during Congress’s August recess. That 30-day window expired Thursday night and the White House has not granted the request for extra time.
The Obama administration has sold more weapons to the Saudis than any other administration, pledging more than $115 billion worth of small arms, tanks, helicopters, missiles, and aircraft.
So yes, it’s a legitimate moral issue. What it’s not is a legitimate economic issue.
If you’re worried about jobs, military spending is not where you look. It’s an inefficient way to create jobs, because it has a lower multiplier effect — meaning how much it ripples in the wider economy. One study from 2011 found that $1 billion put into military spending would create approximately 11,200 jobs, but that same amount of money put into education creates 26,700 jobs.",Zaid Jilani; Alex Emmons,2016-09-09,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/09/whats-behind-obamas-ongoing-accommodation-of-vladimir-putin/,What's Behind Barack Obama's Ongoing Accommodation of Vladimir Putin?,"When a major party cynically espouses a set of beliefs as a tactic for winning an election, those beliefs get entrenched in popular discourse and often endure well past the election, with very significant consequences. The most significant such rhetorical template in the 2016 election — other than the new Democratic claim that big-money donations do not corrupt the political process — is that Russia is a Grave Enemy of the U.S.; anyone who advocates better relations or less tension with Moscow is a likely sympathizer, stooge, or even agent of Putin; and any associations with the Kremlin render one’s loyalties suspect.
Literally every week ushers in a new round of witch hunts in search of domestic Kremlin agents and new evidence of excessive Putin sympathies. The latest outburst was last night’s discovery that Donald Trump allowed himself to be interviewed by well-known Kremlin propagandist and America-hater Larry King on his RT show. “Criticizing US on Russian TV is something no American, much less an aspiring prez, should do,” pronounced Fred Kaplan. Other guests appearing on that network include Soviet spy Bernard Sanders (who spoke this year to Putin crony and RT host Ed Schultz), Bill Maher (whose infiltrates American culture through his cover as a comedian hosting an HBO program), and Stephen Hawking (whom the FSB has groomed to masquerade as a “physicist” while he carries out un-American activities on behalf of Putin).
Despite the fact that Russia ceased long ago to be guided by anything resembling communism, this linking of one’s political adversaries to the Kremlin is such a potent tactic in the U.S. because of decades of Cold War rhetoric about Moscow. Referring to Putin, Matt Lauer this week asked Trump: “Do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?” Denouncing Trump’s praise of Putin, Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel called the Russian president “a communist leader that’s a potential enemy!” Explaining why Trump’s comments about Russia are so remarkable, the New York Times contended that “Mr. Trump has made improved relations with the Kremlin a centerpiece of his candidacy” in “a fashion that would have been unheard-of for a Republican during or immediately after the Cold War.”
There are all sorts of glaring ironies, and glaring dangers, to this new theme — including the fact that “improved relations with the Kremlin” was a long-time plank of the Democratic Party, which, as a result, was routinely vilified by the American Right as Kremlin agents and sympathizers (as were Republicans such as Nixon and Reagan when they sought better ties with Moscow). But the most glaring irony of all is that as Clinton-led Democrats this year equate overtures toward Russia as evidence of Putin-loving disloyalty — whether it be Trump’s opposition to arming Ukraine or his heretical questioning of NATO — there is an American politician who has, time and again, accommodated Putin, sought to improve relations with Moscow, dismissed as fearmongering the threat Russia poses to the U.S., and repeatedly taken steps that benefited Russian interests.
That politician’s name is Barack Obama. As Trevor Timm wrote yesterday in The Guardian, “Barack Obama seems to be the only politician not playing into the cold war 2.0 hysteria.” Indeed, Obama has continually acted in accord with Russia’s agenda and sought to pour cold water on attempts to revive Cold War rhetoric and policies.
Early last year, U.S. intelligence agencies claimed to have evidence that Russia was making increasingly aggressive military incursions into Ukraine, including with tanks and artillery. Leading foreign policy experts in both parties — including Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Obama’s own Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin E. Dempsey — united to pressure President Obama to send arms to Kiev to ward off what they viewed as Russian aggression. But Obama steadfastly refused. Obama’s recalcitrance became so entrenched that a bipartisan alliance in Congress emerged to introduce legislation to force him to provide lethal aid. As the New York Times reported:
Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said last week that he was so “disappointed” in the administration for not using tools in past legislation authorizing more sanctions against Russia and arms for Ukraine that he was introducing a new bill to “dial up the pressure on Vladimir Putin.”
The Ukraine debate of 2015 was not the only instance in which President Obama has taken action that accommodated Putin and benefited Russian interests. Last year, Russia began bombing Syria in order to protect its long-time client Bashar Assad. While Hillary Clinton and others advocated imposition of a “no-fly zone” to stop the Russians, Obama did nothing. To the contrary, Obama — who himself has spent two years bombing the anti-Assad fighters in Syria whom the U.S. government regards as terrorists (killing many civilians in the process) — is now actively forging a partnership with Putin whereby Russia and the U.S. would jointly bomb agreed-upon targets in Syria (ones opposed to Assad).
Then there’s Obama’s total passivity in the face of accusations from Democrats and others that Putin has been actively and maliciously interfering in U.S. elections this year through hacking, disinformation, and other subversive measures. For those who really believe these claims, shouldn’t the U.S. president be issuing strong condemnations and taking aggressive retaliatory measures? What has Obama done to punish Putin for these transgressions? By all appearances, he’s done nothing. Max Boot — who until recently was one of the country’s most discredited neocon extremists but has now once again become a Respectable and Credible Commentator by virtue of endorsing Clinton over Trump — complained this week about Obama’s submission to Putin:
Even when hacks can be traced to Russia, it’s very difficult to prove that the Kremlin was responsible. But the U.S. government doesn’t need to wait for definitive proof to act, assuming, as appears likely, the evidence is already overwhelming. … And yet no action has been forthcoming so far. …
Reflecting the professorial style of the president, this is an administration that has a tendency to talk problems to death even as they grow worse. … So far the Obama administration, in this area as in so many others, is choosing the take-it-on-the-chin option. …
In fact one suspects that that the information-gathering now being conducted by the intelligence community can provide a convenient cover for administration inaction — how can the president possibly do anything before all the facts are in?
So after acting in Putin’s interests in both Ukraine and Syria, Obama now backs down from challenging or punishing him even when the Russian leader interferes in U.S. elections? The plot does indeed thicken.
But perhaps most bizarre of all was the relentless messaging of the Democratic Party under President Obama during the 2012 campaign. All year long, GOP nominee Mitt Romney tried to alert the country of the menace posed by Putin and the Kremlin. Russia “is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world’s worst actors,” Romney warned.
For his patriotic efforts to warn Americans, what did Romney get in response from Obama-led Democrats? Nothing but derision and scorn. During their foreign policy debate, Obama mocked Romney for his Russia-phobia, telling him: “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because … the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.” Joe Biden “attacked the former Massachusetts governor for being ‘one of a small group of Cold War holdovers,’ for naming Russia as a major threat to the United States.” At the DNC convention, John Kerry scoffed at this Russia-as-Villain cartoon: “Mitt Romney talks like he’s only seen Russia by watching Rocky IV.” The Democrats even made a campaign poster laughing at Romney’s concerns over Putin:
Leading Democrats made it a central theme of 2012 that only someone stuck in antiquated, obsolete Cold War thinking could possibly regard Russia as some sort of dangerous or serious threat:
The Obama-led Democratic Party of 2012 — with very suspect motives and possibly suspect loyalties — tweeted all forms of mockery aimed at Mitt Romney as a result of the GOP nominee’s valiant attempt to warn about the menace of Vladimir Putin:
Romney, who calls Russia our ""No. 1 geopolitical foe,"" doesn't seem to realize it's the 21st century. #RomneyNotReady http://t.co/xcvhOAFS
— The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) October 22, 2012
While it’s true that Russia had not yet annexed Crimea, it was accused of doing all sorts of other things by that point that Democrats today hold up as proof of the Kremlin’s evil — including its incursion into Georgia (2008), its active support of Assad (2012), its imprisonment of Pussy Riot (2012), its alleged poisoning of Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko (2006), its alleged murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya (2006), and the shooting of human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov and journalist Anastasia Baburova (2009). In the face of all that, there were Obama-led Democrats throughout 2012 mercilessly mocking — as outdated Cold War rhetoric; Hillary Clinton called it “dated” — the notion that Russia was a serious threat or that Putin ought to be regarded as serious geopolitical foe.
It is certainly disturbing to watch Donald Trump express admiration for Putin’s domestic authoritarianism and venerate that as “strength.” That’s a valid concern, as it reflects — by his own reckoning — what Trump is likely to do, or what he wants to do, if he becomes president.
But this ongoing attempt to equate a desire for better relations with Russia with disloyalty to America, or to vilify any associations with Moscow as proof of un-American Putin sympathy, is toxic in the extreme. Beyond being dangerous and oppressive, it’s incredibly short-sighted. After all, the politician who, in reality, has most accommodated Vladimir Putin and most eagerly sought to avoid tensions with the Kremlin — up to and including trying to partner with them to bomb Syria — happens to be the one currently occupying the Oval Office: a Democrat.",Glenn Greenwald,2016-09-09,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/09/from-russian-tv-network-little-love-for-donald-trump/,"From Russian TV Network, Not So Much Love for Donald Trump","Donald Trump’s interview with Larry King on the Russian-government-funded television network RT America is being widely seen in the mainstream U.S. media as evidence of unseemly coziness between Trump and authoritarian Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
The interview came after months of claims by Democratic Party officials and news media pundits that the Russian government is trying to get Trump elected.
RT America has a long history of coverage that benefits the Russian government and is critical of the United States, as many former employees have complained.
But there’s one problem with the theory that RT America and the Russian government are fond of Trump: RT America is sometimes more critical of Trump than U.S. media.
The interview with King itself was far from a softball event — with the host pressing Trump on topics from releasing his tax returns to his utter lack of any strategy in the Middle East. And it’s not uncommon to see criticism of Trump on the network.
Host Lee Camp has called Trump a “mediocre wizard who can magically turn unemployment into racism.”
Following Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week — in which he doubled down on harsh rhetoric after supposedly “softening” — RT host Thom Hartmann took Trump to task. “Trump Now Flip Flopping Hourly” read the chyron on the segment, as guest Mark Weisbrot exclaimed, “He doesn’t have a coherent position that stays the same, really, from one day to a next on really any of these issues.” Hartmann’s show has repeatedly labeled Trump’s politics as “fascist,” showing little hesitation with using the word compared to mainstream media.
During Trump’s trip to Mexico, anchor Ed Schultz hosted progressive writer and former Texas agricultural commissioner Jim Hightower, who described Trump and the Mexican president as “one president, and one presidential wannabe who have approval ratings down at the mad cow disease level in both of their countries, so they’re both hugging each other up hoping that this actually means something. It’s a freak show.”
King, who has a well-earned reputation for being an easy interview, actually pushed back when Trump said he’ll release his tax returns only once an audit of them is completed. “Why does the audit, it just confuses me. All you have to do is release the first three pages which is not part of the audit, it just states income, what taxes you paid,” King protested.
Trump’s claim that he has a secret plan to tackle ISIS also elicited King’s scorn. “You said that you’ve got a plan on ISIS and you don’t want to reveal it because you don’t want the enemy to know. Nixon said the same thing about Vietnam, but there really was no plan,” King also noted.
Unlike NBC’s Matt Lauer, King was not afraid to interrupt Trump to correct him.
Trump said about Iraq: “Once you go in, you gotta go out the right way, and Obama just took everybody out and it was like a shock to the system, and ultimately ISIS developed and now we have them in 26 to 28 countries and it’s a disaster.”
“The timetable was arranged by Bush for the leaving,” King corrected him.
“Well, you know what, let’s look to the future,” Trump said.
King’s last question to Trump caused the interview to end altogether.
“Let’s get something clear, because I know you a long time. On this immigration issue, what are your feelings about Mexican immigrants. What in your gut about — what do you feel about this?” King asked.
Trump offered no response, and the line went silent.
“Donald are you there?” King asked aloud.
“I don’t know what happened there, we did not lose the connection,” he told his audience.
King and Trump’s relationship goes back decades, but the host has already said he won’t be voting for his old acquaintance.
On Friday, the Trump campaign insisted Trump did not know the interview would end up on the Russian-funded network.
RT America for its part ran an article on Friday noting that the media networks that complained about Trump’s interview with King are owned by corporate conglomerates and Trump foes.",Zaid Jilani,2016-09-09,success

“I need help. I am not getting any,” Manning wrote in a statement. “I was driven to suicide by the lack of care for my gender dysphoria that I have been desperate for. I didn’t get any. I still haven’t gotten any.”
Manning announced her identity as a transgender woman on Aug. 22, 2013, a day after she was sentenced to 35 years in military prison.
After attempting to commit suicide in July, Manning was informed by military officials that she was being investigated for “resisting the force cell move team,” “prohibited property,” and “conduct which threatens.” She is facing indefinite solitary confinement, or a return to maximum-security detention.
Starting on Friday, Manning said, she would not willingly consume any food or drink, except water and prescribed medications.
Manning also refused to “voluntarily cut or shorten her hair in any way.” Army officials repeatedly force Manning to cut her hair to “military standards” – an appearance that she says does not reflect her gender identity.
Human rights advocates have repeatedly raised concerns about Manning’s treatment in prison. After her arrest in 2010, she was subjected to solitary confinement for extended periods and repeatedly stripped naked in her cell. Her treatment was so bad that a State Department spokesperson spoke out against the Pentagon and described it as “ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid.”
Since her conviction, Manning has been repeatedly threatened with indefinite solitary confinement, for charges as frivolous as keeping an expired tube of toothpaste in her cell.
According to Manning’s statement Friday, she also filed a “do not resuscitate” letter with the prison’s medical team, which includes any attempt to force-feed her medically.
In January 2010, Manning sent hundreds of thousands of documents to Wikileaks about the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, revealing a dramatically higher number of civilian casualties than the Pentagon publicly acknowledged. The documents also included a video of Apache attack helicopters gunning down two journalists in Baghdad.
Manning was convicted of six counts of espionage in military court in 2013. Because she was indicted under the Espionage Act, she was not allowed to cite the public interest value of her disclosures as a defense. Manning’s lawyers appealed her conviction in May, calling it “grossly unfair and unprecedented.”
Manning has written numerous opinion columns in The Guardian from prison.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/09/whos-left-at-guantanamo-fates-of-61-prisoners-are-undecided/,Who’s Left at Guantánamo? Fates of Dozens of Prisoners Are Undecided,"The last Guantánamo detainee to make the case for his release before a panel of senior administration officials is also the youngest man left at the island prison.
In a hearing Thursday of Guantánamo’s Periodic Review Board, Hassan Ali Bin Attash, a Yemeni who is believed to be about 31 years old, said through representatives that he was working toward a high school GED diploma and hoped to join relatives in Saudi Arabia and find a job as a translator.
Attash’s exact birthdate is uncertain, but he was certainly a young teen in 1997, when the U.S. military alleges that he pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden and began working for senior al Qaeda figures doing everything from bomb-making to logistics. He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and spent the next two years being moved between CIA black-site prisons and interrogations in Afghanistan and Jordan before landing in Guantánamo in September 2004. While in U.S. custody, according to his own and other prisoners’ accounts, he was subjected to sleep deprivation, hung from a bar by his wrists, and threatened with dogs and electric shocks, among other forms of torture. He was also severely tortured by the Jordanians.
The military assessment filed for the board states that in Saudi Arabia, Attash could easily reconnect with terrorist actors, and that his family is also suspect. Attash’s older brother Walid bin Attash is one of the five men being tried before the Guantánamo military commission for the 9/11 attacks.
His lawyer, David Remes, countered that allegation, saying that he has never heard the younger Attash express anti-American or extremist views.
“Now a young man, with a mind of his own, he is no longer under the sway of others and can make independent decisions,” Remes told the board.
As with all hearings before the Periodic Review Board — a sort of parole process for Guantánamo detainees — the proceedings were piped by video from Cuba to media and other observers in a room at the Pentagon. Attash, who has previously been seen in photos in an orange jumpsuit with wild hair, appeared as a neatly groomed young man. Detainees are not allowed to speak during the open portion of the hearing.
Attash’s hearing marks the end of a three-year process in which the Obama administration has reconsidered the cases of many of the last men left at Guantánamo, with the aim of closing the prison before the president leaves office. As of today, all of the detainees who were eligible for a Periodic Review Board hearing have had one.
The final hearing provides an opportunity to look at the 61 men left in Guantánamo and what the administration proposes to do with them.
Twenty men are now approved for transfer to another country. Seven are currently facing charges at the military commissions, Guantánamo’s war court (this includes the five accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks). One remaining detainee has already been convicted by the war court, and two others pleaded guilty. Another 12, including Hassan Attash, have had their hearing but are still awaiting the board’s decision.
Nineteen fall into the intractable category of prisoners who have not been referred for prosecution, but whom officials believe they cannot safely release. The board recommended these men for “continued detention under the law of war” — in other words, slating them for indefinite detention.
“In the next few months, it will be interesting to see whether the administration uses all of its powers to release the many men left who are not yet cleared but who it has no intention of charging,” said Shayana Kadidal, senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents many detainees. “That will show whether the president is genuinely committed to closing the prison or just intends to leave his own unfinished promises for the next president to resolve.”
The administration’s effort to classify detainees has evolved over the years. After Obama’s year-one promise to close Guantánamo, he convened a task force to evaluate the cases of all the detainees there, recommending them for prosecution, continued detention, or transfer to another country.
Obama also established the Periodic Review Boards (known in Gitmo lingo as PRBs) to regularly evaluate the situation of each detainee the task force had recommended for detention or trial, in order to determine whether they still pose a threat to the United States or if they could be safely released. The board includes representatives from the departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Justice, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence. They don’t take up the legality of holding the prisoner. Instead, they consider the intelligence against the detainee, and whether it still holds up, as well as the detainee’s behavior and activities. They also consider what life after Guantánamo would look like — family and other support networks, job prospects, and the stability of their home country.
As such, the review boards offer a rare glimpse into life at the prison, with detainees often submitting personal details, reports from vocational or language classes, or even paintings. Remes, Attash’s lawyer, said that “when the prison still made such publications as the Washington Post and New York Times available to detainees, Hassan devoured them.” (A Guantánamo public affairs officer would not comment on whether those newspapers were allowed but said that the “intellectual stimulation program” for detainees “includes books, magazines and puzzles, newspapers, handheld electronic games, movies and satellite television.”)
The administration has been criticized for the slow start to the PRB process; the first hearing didn’t happen until 2013. This year, as the prison’s population dipped below 100 for the first time, the pace of the PRBs sped up.
When someone is cleared for transfer, the administration has to find a place to resettle him, which is particularly tricky when his home country isn’t an option (many of the remaining men are from Yemen, which is currently embroiled in a devastating war).
The prisoners slated for indefinite detention present a bigger conundrum. Each prisoner may have his PRB file reviewed every six months, and after three years (if the regime at Guantánamo continues) he’d be eligible for another hearing. One detainee is already scheduled for his second PRB hearing in October.
The Pentagon says that whatever the decision of the PRB, the administration can continue to evaluate “individualized disposition” options, including transfer, prosecution in the military commissions or by another country, or, should Congress lift the current ban on bringing Guantánamo inmates to the United States, imprisoning them or trying them domestically (recent court decisions have limited the types of charges the military tribunals can bring).
In other cases, the detainees are unlikely to be tried because the evidence against them is tainted by torture (already an issue in other military commissions proceedings) or because there simply isn’t much evidence against them at all, said Kadidal, of the Center for Constitutional Rights. “Most of these men are in fact not people who are worthy of prosecution,” he said.
If the U.S. government continues to assert that it can hold them under the law of war, Kadidal said, “we can expect continued challenges” in federal court questioning whether the conflicts justifying the detentions are really still taking place.
“If not, continued detention is illegal,” he said.",Cora Currier; Margot Williams,2016-09-09,success

Por isso, não foi uma surpresa ver que a matéria que publicamos na semana passada, analisando os cortes drásticos nos 11 principais programas sociais do governo na primeira proposta orçamentária apresentada por Michel Temer, foi criticada por grupos da direita que apoiam suas reformas em favor de grandes industriais e “economias livres”. A surpresa veio na forma da ferocidade junto com a completa falta de base das acusações, jogando contra nosso trabalho.
O editor de um site direito-libertário, o “Instituto Mercado Popular” (IMP), assinou um post na página de Facebook deles, divulgado a seus 35 mil seguidores, chamando nossa análise, que comparava a proposta de Temer com a de Dilma Rousseff no ano anterior, de “porca” e “tudo mentira”. Ele chegou a essa conclusão porque “aquele projeto de orçamento [de Rousseff] era uma ilusão, e o gasto efetivo nessas áreas foi menor”. Ou seja, que a proposta orçamentária de 2016 era irrelevante porque os gastos verdadeiros em áreas sociais eram muito inferiores, criando a “falsa conclusão” de que Temer está propondo grandes cortes nessas áreas.

Vamos aos números.
Desde que o Orçamento de 2016 foi aprovado e implementado, de acordo com um levantamento via Siafi (conforme dados disponíveis para consulta pública no sistema Siga Brasil, gerenciado pelo Senado Federal), houve, sim, R$ 2,18 bilhões em reduções de gastos no conjunto dos 11 programas sociais destacados inicialmente pelo The Intercept Brasil. Mas R$ 953 milhões (ou 43,6%) foram cortados nos três meses da interinidade de Michel Temer. O corte total nessas áreas foi de 1,17% de tudo o que havia sido projetado, inicialmente, pelo governo Dilma Rousseff, e 1,16% do que foi aprovado pelo Congresso em números nominais.
Desta vez, não gastamos nosso tempo corrigindo esses números para considerar a taxa de inflação no período, pois é sexta-feira, e a diferença é tão esmagadora que a natureza difamatória e mal-informada do crítico do IMP fica evidente. Para quem não leu nossa matéria, o governo Temer propõe um corte de R$ 29,2 bilhões (corrigido para inflação) nos mesmos 11 programas — uma queda real de 14% e uma redução media de 30% por programa. Essa diferença de dezenas de bilhões de reais é o que qualquer observador sóbrio chamaria de “cortes marcados”.
Outro ponto que o editor do Instituto Mercado Popular traz em seu post de Facebook, com bastante destaque, é que houve variações nas previsões de crescimento do PIB em 2016 e 2017 que impactaram negativamente a economia e a arrecadação de impostos. O fato é que a reportagem verificou, com base nas duas propostas orçamentárias, que o montante total de despesas do Orçamento Fiscal e da Seguridade Social programadas para 2017 é 4,8% maior (já descontada a inflação) do que o previsto por Dilma no momento da sua proposta orçamentária ao Congresso, no ano passado.
Ou seja, a grande questão, aqui, é entender por que há uma projeção (significativa) de menos recursos para os programas sociais listados, enquanto, dentro desse mesmo bolo, a fatia de áreas como defesa, agronegócio, política espacial e política nuclear, entre outros, apresenta crescimento. A base de recursos é a mesma. Por que, afinal, houve mudança no tamanho das fatias? É uma simples e legítima questão de prioridades (embora fosse muito mais legítima se os eleitores tivessem votado por um governo que fosse seguir nessa linha).
Também é importante deixar claro para quem ainda estiver interessado no assunto que, com todo o critério jornalístico que temos por obrigação e pelo nosso prazer em trabalhar, tivemos o cuidado de:
- Comparar a proposta de Orçamento não com a lei aprovada pelo Congresso ou mesmo com os valores efetivamente autorizados ao longo da execução orçamentária deste ano, mas, sim, com a proposta de orçamento apresentada exatamente um ano atrás pelo governo Dilma, como explicam os primeiros parágrafos da matéria. Não comparamos alhos com bugalhos.
- Corrigirmos os valores considerando a inflação do período, referente aos preços de mercado (IGP-M). Afinal, não estamos falando de algo que custa R$ 10 hoje e que passará a custar um real a mais dali a um ano. Estamos falando de coisas de R$ 5 bilhões que viram algo, em média, R$ 550 milhões mais caras.
- Deixarmos claro no título, assim como no gráfico publicado, que o Orçamento apresentado era uma “proposta”, não o Orçamento final, assim como foi no caso de Dilma. O título da reportagem é “Temer pede”. Além disso, a reportagem termina com esta observação, que reafirmamos aqui:
“Toda essa numeralha envolve apenas a proposta inicial de gastos. Esses valores serão trabalhados no Congresso e podem aumentar ou, considerando o perfil da base aliada, diminuir ainda mais. Além disso, na execução do Orçamento ao longo do ano que vem, o governo poderá promover diretamente o chamado contingenciamento de recursos – ou, traduzindo, fazer ainda mais cortes naquilo que já foi cortado.”
Imaginamos que o IMP tenha parado de ler a reportagem antes do final.
Poderíamos continuar, mas parece que uma acusação tão rasa não merece mais do nosso tempo, nem o seu.
Seria interessante, entretanto, saber por que os integrantes do Instituto Mercado Popular não pegam as íntegras das propostas orçamentárias de 2016 e 2017 e produzem um texto para o seu público a respeito dos números, indicando onde, exatamente, existe uma perspectiva de melhoria nos recursos que estarão disponíveis para os principais programas sociais. Talvez já se consiga deduzir a resposta.
Agora, vale a pena analisar quem é que acusou o The Intercept Brasil de publicar “mentiras ideologicamente motivadas”.
O escritor, Pedro Menezes, é editor do blog do Instituto Mercado Popular (IMP) e estudante do curso de graduação de economia no Insper, de acordo com sua biografia no site. O IMP, um grupo com oito integrantes listado no seu site, acredita que o liberalismo econômico é o caminho mais adequado para garantir bem-estar aos mais pobres e cita Adam Smith na abertura de seu manifesto ao público. É uma de várias novas organizações e “think tanks” no Brasil com nomes pomposos, fundado por integrantes de um movimento da extrema direita criado e orientado nos EUA.
Geralmente, entre esses grupos, existem uma a abundância de coligações para que um grupo pequeno possa estrategicamente criar a ilusão de um amplo movimento “grassroots”, torcendo exatamente para os tipos de reformas que o governo Temer e seus apoiadores estão tentando implementar (com o bônus de quase todo mundo envolvido poder botar no currículo ser “co-fundador” de X e “diretor” de Y e talvez ganhar uma bolsa para fazer um treinamento nos EUA). O IMP foi fundado em 2013 exclusivamente por membros do grupo Estudantes pela Liberdade, que é o berço, entre outros, do líder do Movimento Brasil Livre, Kim Kataguiri.
O “Estudantes pela Liberdade”, por sua vez, é descendente direto do americano “Students for Liberty”, uma organização surgida em 2008 com o apoio de entidades conservadoras dos EUA, entre eles os irmãos Charles e David Koch, apoiadores de várias causas neoliberais, libertárias, anti-regulação e pro-industria e que estão, ambos, entre os dez homens mais ricos do mundo. O conglomerado deles, a Koch Industries, é a segunda maior empresa de capital fechado nos Estados Unidos.
Agradecemos ao IMB a oportunidade de esclarecer e reforçar nosso trabalho e elucidar a falta de rigor no seu. The Intercept Brasil foi fundado porque acreditamos que existe uma carência de debate e análise bem informada sobre os assuntos mais importantes no Brasil atualmente e que esse vácuo serve aos interesses dos mais ricos e poderosos do país (parecido com os que se alinham com grupos como o IMP), que estrangulam os tradicionais meios de comunicação no país.
Pretendemos corrigir nossos erros rápida e transparentemente, sempre que necessário, e defender nosso trabalho quando atacado de forma espúria, como foi o caso desta vez. Novos adversários, sejam bem-vindos ao debate.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/10/donald-trumps-view-of-military-sexual-assault-is-chauvinistic-and-not-uncommon/,Donald Trump’s View of Military Sexual Assault Is Chauvinistic — and Not Uncommon,"Donald Trump’s latest attempt to deflect criticism about a 2013 tweet in which he blamed the prevalence of sexual assault in the military on the presence of women has been to criticize the military court system for letting offenders go unprosecuted.
But a big reason the military court system is so ineffective at punishing sexual assault offenders is precisely because senior members of the chain of command are involved — and too many share Trump’s view that rape and sexual assault are inevitable given the circumstances.
This is the tweet in question:
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2013
“Many in the military would be nodding their heads in agreement in that statement. I would not say the majority, but too many would be,” said Col. Don Christensen, former Air Force chief prosecutor and president of Protect Our Defenders — an organization dedicated to ending rape and sexual assault in the military — in an interview with The Intercept.
Trump defended his views on sexual assault in the military on NBC’s Commander-in-Chief forum on Wednesday.
“Well, it is — it is — it is a correct tweet,” he said.
NBC’s Matt Lauer asked: “So this should have been expected? And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?”
Trump responded: “Well, it’s happening, right? And, by the way, since then, it’s gotten worse. No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen. Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. … You have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted. There are no consequence.
“When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person. You have to go after that person. Right now, nobody’s doing anything. Look at the small number of results. I mean, that’s part of the problem.”
On CNN that night, former Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling echoed Trump’s view that rape in such cases is inevitable. “It is a problem, and there are ways that the military is fixing that problem,” he said, “but certainly when you put young people together, these kinds of things happen to a small percentage.”
Actually, in the current system victims often won’t report their assaults. “The low reporting and conviction rates of sexual violence are complicated. This is partially due to the revictimization of the reporting and judicial process,” wrote activist Melanie Carlson in The Hill.
Survivors of sexual assault in the military have been met with retaliation, a 2015 Human Rights Watch report found.
“I knew when I reported my career would be over. Based on past experience, I knew what would happen,” said Lisa Cox, a Navy petty officer, according to the report.
Time magazine reported that Army Lt. Emily Vorland was discharged for “unacceptable conduct” after an Army investigation into claims that a higher-ranking male sexually harassed her.
When an individual in the military seeks legal action, the case is brought to a court system where everyone is operating in a chain of command — something that Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has sought repeatedly to change through legislation.
Christensen said that sexual assault cases in military court are lengthy and arduous. “I have prosecuted and defended almost every case you can imagine — sexual assault is the most difficult you can do,” he said.
“No one should have to suffer the chain of command when they report these crimes,” Gillibrand said last year. “Retaliation happens so often that a majority of these assaults go unreported. Every military victim of sexual assault deserves due process, professional treatment by a trained military official at each opportunity to seek and receive justice.”
In 2014, Hillary Clinton announced her support for Gillibrand’s bill in an interview on CNN. “And remember, it’s not only women, it’s men who’ve been assaulted as well,” she said.",Naomi LaChance,2016-09-10,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/10/fifteen-years-after-911-neverending-war/,"Fifteen Years After 9/11, Neverending War","In the days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when Congress voted to authorize military force against the people who “planned, authorized, committed, or aided” the hijackings, few Americans could have imagined the resulting manhunt would span from West Africa all the way to the Philippines, and would outlast two two-term presidents.
Today, U.S. military engagement in the Middle East looks increasingly permanent. Despite the White House having formally ended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of U.S. troops and contractors remain in both countries. The U.S. is dropping bombs on Iraq and Syria faster than it can make them, and according to the Pentagon, its bombing campaign in Libya has “no end point at this particular moment.” The U.S. is also helping Saudi Arabia wage war in Yemen, in addition to conducting occasional airstrikes in Yemen and Somalia.
Fifteen years after the September 11 attacks, it looks like the war on terror is still in its opening act.
The drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan only revealed how little war has achieved and how much damage it has inflicted. In Afghanistan, the Taliban now holds more territory than it has at any point since 2001. One poll from 2016 found that more than 90 percent of young people in Iraq now consider the United States an “enemy” of their country.
The Islamic State, which was largely created by the U.S. invasion of Iraq, controls vast swaths of territory in Iraq, Syria, and Libya, and has demonstrated an emboldened capability to orchestrate attacks in Europe. In June, CIA Director John Brennan told Congress that “despite all our progress against ISIL on the battlefield and in the financial realm, our efforts have not reduced the group’s terrorism capability and global reach.”
Al Qaeda, the original enemy, today controls territory in Yemen and Somalia, but it is no longer considered a priority. In the span of one year, for example, the U.S.-backed war in Yemen quadrupled the size of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula — the terror group’s most dangerous offshoot. The CIA has continued to arm Syrian rebels, despite the fact that those weapons have found their way to a former al Qaeda affiliate. Retired Gen. David Petraeus, formerly the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, actually suggested arming al Qaeda directly to help fight ISIS.
Despite the lack of progress, the last 15 years of war have come at a horrific cost.
The U.S. lost nearly 2,300 service members in Afghanistan, and nearly 4,500 in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands were forever damaged. Those figures do not include at least 6,900 U.S. contractors and at least 43,000 Afghan and Iraqi troops who lost their lives.
The death toll in the countries the U.S. attacked remains untallied, but conservative estimates range from the hundreds of thousands to well over a million. Add to that the hundreds of people tortured in U.S. custody, and thousands killed by U.S. drones in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.
The financial cost of the war on terror is incalculable. The Iraq and Afghan wars, including the medical costs for veterans, are estimated to end up costing the U.S. at least $4 trillion dollars. Intelligence budgets have doubled, on top of more than $800 billion spent on “homeland security.”
Billions of dollars have been wasted on fruitless projects — like a failed plan to install radiation detectors at airports, which cost the government $230 million. The Department of Homeland Security wasted $1.1 billion on a “virtual fence” of sensors along the Mexican border before scrapping the program. The examples go on and on. The CIA paid one contractor $20 million to build a program that could discover encoded terrorist messages in Al Jazeera news broadcasts. Just last year, the Pentagon spent $43 million on one gas station in Afghanistan. Two contract psychologists were paid $80 million for designing the CIA’s torture program.
After 15 years, the only winners in the war on terror have been the contractors.
At home, the war on terror has become a constitutional nightmare. The U.S. has adopted a practice of indefinitely detaining terror suspects. Police departments across the country secretly import military-grade spy equipment. Courts have ruled that families cannot sue to get their children off government kill lists. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the U.S. has become the largest surveillance state in history.
In the 2016 presidential campaigns, torture has become one party’s applause line, in no small part due to President Obama’s failure to prosecute the architects of the Bush-era torture program.
Bombing multiple countries in the Middle East has become business as usual, and often goes unreported. On August 1, for example, the day the Obama administration announced a new bombing campaign against ISIS in Libya, American journalists were far more occupied with post-convention election polls than they were with the new war.
All of this foreshadows a war that could stretch 10, 20, or 50 more years. As the U.S. shifts its strategy toward bombing and away from ground troops, media engagement with the wars diminishes, and it is all too easy to forget about our permanent state of war. But the victims of U.S. violence are unlikely to forget, creating a potentially endless supply of new enemies.",Alex Emmons,2016-09-10,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/11/as-vaias-ao-presidente-e-a-operacao-passa-pano/,As vaias ao presidente e a Operação Passa-Pano | Intercept Brasil,"Na véspera da cerimônia de abertura dos Jogos Olímpicos, o presidente não-eleito lembrou que, no Maracanã, “vaia-se até minuto de silêncio”. A frase de Nelson Rodrigues não poderia ser mais verdadeira. Se até presidentes eleitos foram vaiados, por que um que chegou ao cargo catapultado pela gangue de Eduardo Cunha e implantou um programa de governo rejeitado nas urnas não seria?
Tanto na abertura das Olimpíadas quanto na das Paraolimpíadas, uma Operação Passa-Pano foi montada para que vaias e xingamentos não fossem ouvidos na transmissão da TV. Mas não adiantou, o barulho e o constrangimento foram enormes.
E eu tenho a leve impressão de que a operação conta com um braço jornalístico muito eficaz. Há um grande empenho das manchetes e do colunismo em minimizar as vaias e os protestos que o presidente vem sofrendo dia sim, dia sim.
Eliane Cantanhede, a colunista da massa cheirosa que chegou a implorar por uma “trégua a Temer”, comentou na abertura das Olimpíadas: “Temer foi vaiado por alguns segundos. E daí?”.
O Antagonista de Diogo Mainardi deixou sua famosa agressividade de lado e pediu docemente para o presidente não se incomodar com as vaias.
A jornalista Mary Zaidan também tentou estancar a sangria em seu Twitter: “Insisto: só quem votou em Temer está gritando ‘Fora, Temer’”. Nessa livre e ousada interpretação dos fatos, apenas quem votou em Dilma deseja a saída de Temer. Talvez ela ache que esses eleitores deveriam ter consultado as cartas de tarô para descobrir que o vice trairia a plataforma de governo pela qual foi eleito.
Miriam Leitão foi além e terceirizou as vaias de Temer para Dilma. Em coluna na “CBN” intitulada “Vaias a Temer são por decisões tomadas por Dilma”*, a economista deu sua valorosa contribuição para a operação.
O Jornal Nacional fez um breve resumo dos protestos em todo país no dia 7 de setembro e destacou que em São Paulo a marcha foi “liderada por mascarados”, numa clara tentativa de desqualificar os protestos.
O trabalho da operação tem sido árduo. Em poucos meses como presidente, Michel Temer já possui uma vasta coleção de vaias. Ele, que para muitos é um Dom Pedro contemporâneo que nos libertou das garras do bolivarianismo e impediu que nossa bandeira se tornasse vermelha, acordou sendo vaiado no desfile de 7 de setembro e foi dormir sendo vaiado na abertura das Paralimpíadas. Conseguiu a façanha de levar pra casa duas enormes vaias no mesmo dia. Quer dizer, segundo a Globo, ele foi vaiado, mas “algumas pessoas aplaudiram”. Não foi tão ruim assim.
Nos protestos que reuniram milhares de pessoas em todo o Brasil nos dias seguintes ao impeachment, José Serra saiu em defesa do seu presida e desdenhou dos manifestantes. Segundo ele, foram atos de “pequenos grupos organizados”, uma minoria que classificou como “mini mini mini mini mini mini” – seis “minis”.
O chefe da Casa Civil, Geddel, apontou a irrelevância do protesto no desfile da Independência: “a dimensão é de 18 pessoas em 18 mil”.
Quando foi buscar legitimidade na China, o presidente não-eleito respondeu ao ser perguntado se as manifestações poderiam atrapalhar o início de seu governo: “As 40 pessoas que quebram carro? Precisa perguntar para os 204 milhões de brasileiros”.
Bom, uma pesquisa Datafolha de abril já perguntou. E o resultado foi que 58% dos brasileiros defendem o impeachment de Temer. Já o Ibope, da mesma época, trouxe um número ainda pior: apenas 8% da população quer vê-lo como presidente do país. De lá pra cá, nada mudou. Nas capitais, a aprovação de Temer está entre 8% a 19%, segundo pesquisa Ibope divulgada na semana passada.
Parece que o número de pessoas insatisfeitas é um pouco maior que 40, não é mesmo? A insatisfação não é tão mini mini mini mini e nem parte apenas dos que votaram na chapa Dilma/Temer. Haja pano pra passar!
É importante frisar que a nossa querida imprensa não deixou de registrar as vaias. Ela sempre publica tudo, vocês já sabem. Peguemos o Estadão como exemplo. Foi assim que ele publicou as vaias para Lula, na abertura do Panamericano, e para Dilma, na abertura da Copa do Mundo:
Agora, quando as vaias foram direcionadas para o seu novo queridinho, o jornalismo do Estadão precisou se adequar. Essas foram as capas publicadas nos dias seguintes às aberturas das Olimpíadas e Paraolimpíadas:
O Estadão fez bonito e cumpriu com louvor seu papel na Operação Passa-Pano. É preciso de uma lupa e muita boa vontade para encontrar os protestos contra Temer. Talvez a Família Mesquita não queira que a massa leitora de manchetes nas bancas de jornais fique sabendo desse revés.
Vamos ver até quando os paninhos continuarão sendo passados. Com os protestos ganhando corpo e a rejeição aumentando, a tendência é que a sujeira se acumule. E, segundo a lógica do próprio Temer, será muito difícil que ele chegue ao fim do seu governo. Há um ano, o então vice-presidente fez a seguinte afirmação sobre a ex-presidenta: “Com 7% de aprovação, fica muito difícil concluir seu mandato”. Bem, como vimos, a aprovação de Temer está variando entre 8 a 19% nas capitais.
*Logo após a publicação, o título da coluna foi trocado e Miriam disse que não foi bem isso o que quis dizer. Acontece. Algum estagiário abusado deve ter trocado o título a seu bel prazer.

Bush demanded from Congress the legal authorization to use military force against those responsible for the attack, which everyone understood would start with an invasion of Afghanistan. The resulting resolution that was immediately cooked up was both vague and broad, providing that “the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.”
Despite this broadness, or because of it, the House of Representatives on September 14 approved the resolution by a vote of 420-1. The Senate approved it the same day by a vote of 98-0. The lone dissenting vote was Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California, who — three days after the 9/11 attack, in a climate of virtually full-scale homogeneity — not only voted “no” but stood up on the House floor to deliver this eloquent, unflinching and, as it turns out, extremely prescient explanation for her opposition:
In an op-ed she published in the San Francisco Chronicle nine days later, she explained her vote by pointing out that the resolution “was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the Sept. 11 events — anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation’s long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit.” She added: “A rush to launch precipitous military counterattacks runs too great a risk that more innocent men, women, children will be killed.”
For her lone stance, Lee was deluged with rancid insults and death threats to the point where she needed around-the-clock bodyguards. She was vilified as “anti-American” by numerous outlets including the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Times editorialized on September 18 that “Ms. Lee is a long-practicing supporter of America’s enemies — from Fidel Castro on down” and that “while most of the left-wing Democrats spent the week praising President Bush and trying to sound as moderate as possible, Barbara Lee continued to sail under her true colors.” Since then, she has been repeatedly rejected in her bids to join the House Democratic leadership, typically losing to candidates close to Wall Street and in support of militarism. I documented numerous other ugly attacks when I wrote about her for The Guardian in 2013.
But beyond the obvious bravery needed to take the stand she took, she has been completely vindicated on the merits. Close to a majority of Americans now believes that the first war the AUMF was invoked to launch — the one in Afghanistan — was a mistake. Fifteen years later, the very same AUMF continues to be used by the Obama administration for all sorts of wars that plainly have nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks — including its newfound bombing partnership with Russia in Syria. Under this resolution, Obama has bombed seven predominantly Muslim countries in seven years; a 2013 memo from the Congressional Research Service, requested by Lee, listed all the military actions and related abuses undertaken purportedly under its authority:
It’s impossible to overstate how correct Lee was when she warned that this resolution would constitute “a blank check” to wage war “anywhere, in any country,” and “without time limit.” Fifteen years later, this “war” is raging as destructively as ever, with no end in sight. Indeed, as my Intercept colleague Alex Emmons documented today, “Fifteen years after the September 11 attacks, it looks like the war on terror is still in its opening act.” Either one of the two leading presidential candidates is certain to use this resolution for all new expressions of this war.
Lee has never given up on this cause, repeatedly attempting to lead a repeal of the AUMF, though — in the face of opposition from two successive administrations, one from each party — she has never been able to convince her colleagues to do so. While her “blank check” warning turned out to be incredibly prescient, the other warning she issued, from the House floor on September 14, was even more profound: “Let us not become the evil we deplore.”
The 9/11 attack killed close to 3,000 innocent people, but the 15 years of wars, bombings, invasions, occupations, and other abuses it spawned — the bulk of which are still raging — have killed many, many more than that. Americans love to memorialize the victims of the 9/11 attacks, though the abundant victims of their own government’s actions (both leading up to 9/11 and in response to it) are typically ignored. Whatever else 9/11 is used to commemorate, Barbara Lee’s visionary warnings and solitary courage should always be near the top of that list.",Glenn Greenwald,2016-09-11,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/pharma-opioid-marijuana/,"Pharma Company Funding Anti-Pot Fight Worried About Losing Business, Filings Show","Pharmaceutical executives who recently made a major donation to an anti-marijuana legalization campaign claimed they were doing so out of concern for the safety of children — but their investor filings reveal that pot poses a direct threat to their plans to cash in on a synthetic cannabis product they have developed.
On August 31, Insys Therapeutics Inc. donated $500,000 to Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, becoming the single largest donor to the group leading the charge to defeat a ballot measure in Arizona to legalize marijuana.
The drug company, which currently markets a fast-acting version of the deadly painkiller fentanyl, assured local news reporters that they had the public interest in mind when making the hefty donation. A spokesperson told the Arizona Republic that Insys opposes the legalization measure, Prop. 205, “because it fails to protect the safety of Arizona’s citizens, and particularly its children.”
A Washington Post story on Friday noted the potential self-interest involved in Insys’s donation.
Investor filings examined by The Intercept confirm the obvious.
Insys is currently developing a product called the Dronabinol Oral Solution, a drug that uses a synthetic version of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to alleviate chemotherapy-caused nausea and vomiting. In an early filing related to the dronabinol drug, assessing market concerns and competition, Insys filed a disclosure statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating plainly that legal marijuana is a direct threat to their product line:
Legalization of marijuana or non-synthetic cannabinoids in the United States could significantly limit the commercial success of any dronabinol product candidate. … If marijuana or non-synthetic cannabinoids were legalized in the United States, the market for dronabinol product sales would likely be significantly reduced and our ability to generate revenue and our business prospects would be materially adversely affected.
Insys explains in the filing that dronabinol is “one of a limited number of FDA-approved synthetic cannabinoids in the United States” and “therefore in the United States, dronabinol products do not have to compete with natural cannabis or non-synthetic cannabinoids.”
The company concedes that scientific literature has argued the benefits of marijuana over synthetic dronabinol, and that support for marijuana legalization is growing. In the company’s latest 10-K filing with the SEC, in a section outlining competitive threats, Insys warns that several states “have already enacted laws legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana.”
Subsys, the fentanyl spray Insys makes, is used as a fast-acting pain reliever. Fentanyl is an opioid that has made headlines in recent years as the number of Americans overdosing on the drug has skyrocketed. Fenatyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and has been linked to the death of Prince earlier this year. Last month, two Insys executives pled guilty to a pay-for-play scheme to use speakers fees as a way to get doctors to prescribe Subsys.
Marijuana advocates claim that legalized pot has a variety of medical uses, including pain relief.
It’s not the first time pharmaceutical companies have helped bankroll the opposition to marijuana reform. Thereceived corporate sponsorship from Purdue Pharma, the makers of Oxycontin, and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, another opioid manufacturer.
Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, a nonprofit that organizes anti-marijuana activism across the country, has longJ.P. Holyoak, chairman of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a group supporting the legalization ballot measure, released a statement condemning the Insys donation. “Our opponents have made a conscious decision to associate with this company,” Holyoak said. “They are now funding their campaign with profits from the sale of opioids — and maybe even the improper sale of opioids.”",Lee Fang,2016-09-12,success

Bush exigiu autorização do Congresso para utilizar força militar contra os responsáveis pelo ataque, que evidentemente seria utilizada para justificar a invasão do Afeganistão. A resolução que foi criada por consequência era vaga, abrangente e estipulava:
“O presidente está autorizado a usar todo o tipo de força necessária e adequada contra as nações, organizações ou pessoas que ele constatar terem planejado, autorizado, cometido ou auxiliado os ataques terroristas ocorridos em 11 de setembro de 2001, ou que tenham abrigado tais organizações ou pessoas.”

O único voto de dissidência veio da deputada democrata pela Califórnia, Barbara Lee, que, apenas três dias depois do ataque de 11 de setembro, em um ambiente de unanimidade praticamente absoluta, votou contra a resolução e, além disso, subiu ao púlpito da Câmara para proferir uma justificativa aos seus opositores de forma eloquente, resoluta e, conforme ficou comprovado, extremamente presciente:
Em um editorial publicado nove dias depois no San Francisco Chronicle, a deputada explicou seu voto, salientando que a resolução “era um cheque em branco para que o presidente pudesse atacar qualquer envolvido nos acontecimentos de 11 de setembro — em qualquer lugar, em qualquer país, independente de nossos interesses econômicos, da segurança nacional e de nossa política externa a longo prazo, além de não ter um limite de tempo”. Ela acrescentou: “A pressa em iniciar contra-ataques militares precipitados gera um risco considerável de que mais homens, mulheres e crianças inocentes percam suas vidas.”
“Vamos parar por apenas um minuto e pensar nas consequências de nossas ações de hoje, para que não percamos o controle.”
Mas, além do reconhecimento pela coragem evidentemente necessária para tomar a posição que tomou, a história fez jus ao seu posicionamento com base no mérito. Quase metade dos americanos crê que a primeira guerra (Afeganistão) que se valeu da Autorização para Uso de Força Militar (Authorization for Use of Military Force – AUMF) foi um erro. Quinze anos depois, a mesma AUMF continua a ser usada pelo Governo de Obama para justificar diversos tipos de guerras que não têm nada a ver com os ataques de 11 de setembro — incluindo sua parceria recentemente revelada com a Rússia na Síria. Valendo-se dessa resolução, Obama bombardeou sete países predominantemente muçulmanos em sete anos; um memorando de 2013 do Serviço de Pesquisa do Congresso (CRS), solicitado por Lee, listou todas as ações e abusos militares supostamente realizados sob a autoridade da resolução:
Não se pode subestimar o nível de precisão do posicionamento de Lee ao alertar que essa resolução representaria um “cheque em branco” para declarar guerras “em qualquer lugar, em qualquer país”, “sem limite de tempo”. Quinze anos depois, essa “guerra” continua sendo mais destrutiva do que nunca, sem um fim à vista. Certamente, conforme meu colega do The Intercept, Alex Emmons, documentou neste domingo, “15 anos depois dos ataques de 11 de setembro, parece que a guerra ao terror ainda de encontra em seu primeiro ato”. É certo que qualquer um dos dois candidatos à presidência usará a resolução para as novas ramificações dessa mesma guerra.Lee não desistiu de sua causa, tentando inúmeras vezes liderar uma revogação da AUMF, mas, devido à oposição de dois governos consecutivos (um de cada partido), não conseguiu obter o apoio de seus colegas. Ainda que seu alerta a respeito do “cheque em branco” tenha sido extremamente presciente, o outro alerta que deu, em 14 de setembro, no púlpito da Câmara, foi ainda mais profundo: “Não nos tornemos o mal que deploramos.”
Os ataques de 11 de setembro mataram quase 3 mil pessoas, mas os 15 anos de guerras bombardeios, invasões, ocupações e outros abusos — em sua grande maioria, ainda em curso — fizeram muito mais vítimas do que isso. Os americanos adoram homenagear as vítimas dos ataques de 11 de setembro, mas o abundante número de vítimas resultante das ações de seu próprio governo (tanto antes quanto depois de 11 de setembro) geralmente é ignorado. Independente do que é comemorado em 11 de setembro, os alertas visionários e a coragem solitária de Barbara Lee devem sempre se encontrar entre os primeiros da lista.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/foreign-spending-on-u-s-elections-threatens-national-security-fec-commissioner-says/,"Foreign Spending on U.S. Elections Threatens National Security, FEC Commissioner Says","Calling foreign influence on U.S. elections “a matter of national security,” FEC commissioner Ellen Weintraub is joining her colleague Ann Ravel in calling for the full commission to plug the flow of foreign money into American political campaigns.
In a new memo to her five fellow commissioners, Weintraub writes that the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision created “new avenues for corporate political activity would make our democracy vulnerable to foreign individuals, corporations, and governments that seek to manipulate our elections.” Weintraub will ask the full FEC at its meeting on Thursday to begin the process of writing new regulations to deal with Citizens United and foreign money.
Weintraub cites recent reporting by The Intercept on a $1.3 million donation by a U.S. corporation owned by Chinese citizens to a Super PAC backing Jeb Bush as evidence that this is not a “hypothetical” issue. “A person would have to be wearing some very rose-colored glasses,” Weintraub writes, “to think there are not foreign operatives interested in exploiting any vulnerability to influence our elections.”
Her fellow commissioner Ann Ravel called on the FEC to take action in August, in the wake of The Intercept’s story.
The Citizens United decision opened up a peculiar loophole for foreign money. Federal law prohibits “foreign nationals” — a legal term encompassing foreign individuals, corporations and governments — from putting money into the U.S. political process. But federal law also states that any company legally incorporated in the U.S., no matter its ultimate ownership, is a U.S. national.
This was not a significant concern prior to the Citizens United decision, because corporations had been largely barred from spending money on federal elections. By lifting that ban on corporate political donations, Citizens United changed the equation and made it possible for a corporation that is 100 percent owned by foreigners to participate in U.S. politics.
Barack Obama warned in his State of the Union address immediately after the Citizens United ruling that foreign-owned corporations would now be able to “spend without limit in our elections.” Justice Samuel Alito, part of the Citizens United majority, was in the audience and shook his head at Obama’s claim, mouthing “not true.”
The Intercept obtained a memo from Charles Spies, one of the Republican Party’s top campaign finance lawyers, written for a client and showing exactly how to do it.
Weintraub is asking the FEC to direct its counsel to begin the process of creating new regulations to close the Citizens United loophole and prevent corporations with significant foreign ownership from participating in U.S. elections.
“Our courts have said that foreign money may be barred from our elections,” Weintraub writes in her conclusion. “Congress has said that foreign money must be barred from our elections. The American public has the right to expect the Federal Election Commission to ensure that foreign money is barred from our elections.”
Ravel’s proposal, also on the agenda for this Thursday’s FEC meeting, would not go as far as Weintraub’s. Rather than calling for the commission to create entirely new regulations, Ravel is asking the commission to rescind previous advisory opinions that outlined how foreign-owned corporations could legally spend small amounts of their own money to set up a company-sponored political action committee that would then receive donations from U.S. citizens. Spies relied on those opinions in his memo to create an avenue for foreign-owned corporations to make unlimited donations to Super PACs from their own treasuries.
There is cause for skepticism that the FEC will take action on either proposal. The commission has six members and by law no more than three can be from the same political party. In the past this had led to frequent 3-3 deadlocks, with the Republican commissioners consistently voting against investigations or new regulation of campaign donations. Weintraub and Ravel are the commission’s two Democrats; Steven T. Walther, an independent, often votes with them.",Jon Schwarz,2016-09-12,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/long-secret-stingray-manuals-detail-how-police-can-spy-on-phones/,Long-Secret Stingray Manuals Detail How Police Can Spy on Phones,"Harris Corp.’s Stingray surveillance device has been one of the most closely guarded secrets in law enforcement for more than 15 years. The company and its police clients across the United States have fought to keep information about the mobile phone-monitoring boxes from the public against which they are used. The Intercept has obtained several Harris instruction manuals spanning roughly 200 pages and meticulously detailing how to create a cellular surveillance dragnet.
Harris has fought to keep its surveillance equipment, which carries price tags in the low six figures, hidden from both privacy activists and the general public, arguing that information about the gear could help criminals. Accordingly, an older Stingray manual released under the Freedom of Information Act to news website TheBlot.com last year was almost completely redacted. So too have law enforcement agencies at every level, across the country, evaded almost all attempts to learn how and why these extremely powerful tools are being used — though court battles have made it clear Stingrays are often deployed without any warrant. The San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department alone has snooped via Stingray, sans warrant, over 300 times.
Richard Tynan, a technologist with Privacy International, told The Intercept that the “manuals released today offer the most up-to-date view on the operation of” Stingrays and similar cellular surveillance devices, with powerful capabilities that threaten civil liberties, communications infrastructure, and potentially national security. He noted that the documents show the “Stingray II” device can impersonate four cellular communications towers at once, monitoring up to four cellular provider networks simultaneously, and with an add-on can operate on so-called 2G, 3G, and 4G networks simultaneously.
“There really isn’t any place for innocent people to hide from a device such as this,” Tynan wrote in an email.
“As more of our infrastructure, homes, environment, and transportation are connected wirelessly to the internet, such technologies really do pose a massive risk to public safety and security.”
And the Harris software isn’t just extremely powerful, Tynan added, but relatively simple, providing any law enforcement agent with a modicum of computer literacy the ability to spy on large groups of people:
The ease with which the StingRay II can be used is quite striking and there do not seem to be any technical safeguards against misuse. … It also allows the operator to configure virtually every aspect of the operation of the fake cell tower. … The Gemini platform also allows for the logging and analysis of data to and from the network and “Once a message to/from any active subscriber in the Subscriber list is detected, Gemini will notify the user.” How many innocent communications of the public are analyzed during this process?
Tynan also raised questions about the extent to which Stingrays may be disrupting the communications infrastructure, including existing cellular towers.
Harris declined to comment. In a 2014 letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the company argued that if the owner’s manuals were released under the Freedom of Information Act, this would “harm Harris’s competitive interests” and “criminals and terrorist[s] would have access to information that would allow them to build countermeasures.” But Stingrays are known for spying on low-level marijuana dealers and other domestic targets, not al Qaeda; as the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Jennifer Lynch said in December, “I am not aware of any case in which a police agency has used a cell-site simulator to find a terrorist.” Meanwhile, it is already publicly known that the NSA uses Stingray-like devices to locate suspected terrorists as part of a system known as Gilgamesh. Nathan Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept that “when the most likely ‘countermeasure’ is someone turning their phone off or leaving it at home, it is hard to understand how public release of a manual like this could cause harm.” And furthermore, said Wessler, “It is in the public interest to understand the general capabilities of this technology, so that lawmakers and judges can exercise appropriate oversight and protect people’s privacy rights.”
The documents described and linked below, instruction manuals for the software used by Stingray operators, were provided to The Intercept as part of a larger cache believed to have originated with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Two of them contain a “distribution warning” saying they contain “Proprietary Information and the release of this document and the information contained herein is prohibited to the fullest extent allowable by law.”
Although “Stingray” has become a catch-all name for devices of its kind, often referred to as “IMSI catchers,” the manuals include instructions for a range of other Harris surveillance boxes, including the Hailstorm, ArrowHead, AmberJack, and KingFish. They make clear the capability of those devices and the Stingray II to spy on cellphones by, at minimum, tracking their connection to the simulated tower, information about their location, and certain “over the air” electronic messages sent to and from them. Wessler added that parts of the manuals make specific reference to permanently storing this data, something that American law enforcement has denied doing in the past.
One piece of Windows software used to control Harris’s spy boxes, software that appears to be sold under the name “Gemini,” allows police to track phones across 2G, 3G, and LTE networks. Another Harris app, “iDen Controller,” provides a litany of fine-grained options for tracking phones. A law enforcement agent using these pieces of software along with Harris hardware could not only track a large number of phones as they moved throughout a city but could also apply nicknames to certain phones to keep track of them in the future. The manual describing how to operate iDEN, the lengthiest document of the four at 156 pages, uses an example of a target (called a “subscriber”) tagged alternately as Green Boy and Green Ben:
The documents also make clear just how easy it is to execute a bulk surveillance regime from the trunk of a car: A Gemini “Quick Start Guide,” which runs to 54 pages, contains an entire chapter on logging, which “enables the user to listen and log over the air messages that are being transmitted between the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Mobile Subscriber (MS).” It’s not clear exactly what sort of metadata or content would be captured in such logging. The “user” here, of course, is a police officer.
In order to maintain an uninterrupted connection to a target’s phone, the Harris software also offers the option of intentionally degrading (or “redirecting”) someone’s phone onto an inferior network, for example, knocking a connection from LTE to 2G:
A video of the Gemini software installed on a personal computer, obtained by The Intercept and embedded below, provides not only an extensive demonstration of the app but also underlines how accessible the mass surveillance code can be: Installing a complete warrantless surveillance suite is no more complicated than installing Skype. Indeed, software such as Photoshop or Microsoft Office, which require a registration key or some other proof of ownership, are more strictly controlled by their makers than software designed for cellular interception.
“While this device is being discussed in the context of U.S. law enforcement,” said Tynan, “this could be used by foreign agents against the U.S. public and administration. It is no longer acceptable for our phones and mobile networks to be exploited in such an invasive and indiscriminate way.”

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/facebook-is-collaborating-with-the-israeli-government-to-determine-what-should-be-censored/,Facebook Is Collaborating With the Israeli Government to Determine What Should Be Censored,"Last week, a major censorship controversy erupted when Facebook began deleting all posts containing the iconic photograph of the Vietnamese “Napalm Girl” on the ground that it violated the company’s ban on “child nudity.” Facebook even deleted a post from the prime minister of Norway, who posted the photograph in protest of the censorship. As outrage spread, Facebook ultimately reversed itself — acknowledging “the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time” — but this episode illustrated many of the dangers I’ve previously highlighted in having private tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google become the arbiters of what we can and cannot see.
Having just resolved that censorship effort, Facebook seems to be vigorously courting another. The Associated Press reports today from Jerusalem that “the Israeli government and Facebook have agreed to work together to determine how to tackle incitement on the social media network.” These meetings are taking place “as the government pushes ahead with legislative steps meant to force social networks to rein in content that Israel says incites violence.” In other words, Israel is about to legislatively force Facebook to censor content deemed by Israeli officials to be improper, and Facebook appears eager to appease those threats by working directly with the Israeli government to determine what content should be censored.
The joint Facebook-Israel censorship efforts, needless to say, will be directed at Arabs, Muslims, and Palestinians who oppose Israeli occupation. The AP article makes that clear: “Israel has argued that a wave of violence with the Palestinians over the past year has been fueled by incitement, much of it spread on social media sites.” As Alex Kane reported in The Intercept in June, Israel has begun actively surveilling Palestinians for the content of their Facebook posts and even arresting some for clear political speech. Israel’s obsession with controlling Palestinians’ use of social media is motivated by the way it has enabled political organizing by occupation opponents; as Kane wrote: “A demonstration against the Israeli occupation can be organized in a matter of hours, while the monitoring of Palestinians is made easier by the large digital footprint they leave on their laptops and mobile phones.”
Notably, Israel was represented in this meeting with Facebook by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, an extremist by all measures who has previously said she does not believe in a Palestinian state. Shaked has “proposed legislation that seeks to force social networks to remove content that Israel considers to be incitement,” and recently boasted that Facebook is already extremely compliant with Israeli censorship demands: “Over the past four months Israel submitted 158 requests to Facebook to remove inciting content,” she said, and Facebook has accepted those requests in 95 percent of the cases.
All of this underscores the severe dangers of having our public discourse overtaken, regulated, and controlled by a tiny number of unaccountable tech giants. I suppose some people are comforted by the idea that benevolent Facebook executives like Mark Zuckerberg are going to protect us all from “hate speech” and “incitement,” but — like “terrorism” — neither of those terms have any fixed meanings, are entirely malleable, and are highly subject to manipulation for propagandistic ends. Do you trust Facebook — or the Israeli government — to assess when a Palestinian’s post against Israeli occupation and aggression passes over into censorship-worthy “hate speech” or “incitement”?
While the focus here is on Palestinians’ “incitement,” it’s actually very common for Israelis to use Facebook to urge violence against Palestinians, including settlers urging “vengeance” when there is an attack on an Israeli. Indeed, as the Washington Post recently noted, “Palestinians have also taken issue with social-media platforms, saying they incite violence and foster an Israeli discourse of hatred, racism and discriminatory attitudes against Palestinians.”
In 2014, thousands of Israelis used Facebook to post messages “calling for the murder of Palestinians.” When an IDF occupying soldier was arrested for shooting and killing a wounded Palestinian point blank in the head last year, IDF soldiers used Facebook to praise the killing and justify that violence, with online Israeli mobs gathering in support. Indeed, Justice Minister Shaked herself — now part of the government team helping Facebook determine what to censor — has used Facebook to post astonishingly extremist and violence-inducing rhetoric against Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his other top ministers have done the same. As Al Jazeera America detailed in 2014:
The hate speech against Arabs that gathered momentum on Facebook and Twitter soon spilled out onto the streets of Jerusalem as extremist Israelis kicked up violence and caused chaos. This violence then made its way back online: YouTube and Facebook videos show hundreds of angry Israeli mobs running around chanting, “Death to Arabs,” and looking for Palestinians to attack. A video of an Israeli Jew attacking a Palestinian on a public bus shouting, “Filthy Arabs, filthy Arab murderers of children,” emerged from Tel Aviv. And more video footage showing Israeli security forces using excessive force on a handcuffed Palestinian-American boy further called into question who was really inciting this chaos.
Can anyone imagine Facebook deleting the posts of prominent Israelis calling for increased violence or oppression against Palestinians? Indeed, is it even possible to imagine Facebook deleting the posts of Americans or western Europeans who call for aggressive wars or other forms of violence against predominantly Muslim countries, or against critics of the West? To ask the question is to answer it. Facebook is a private company, with a legal obligation to maximize profit, and so it will interpret very slippery concepts such as “hate speech” and “inciting violence” to please those who wield the greatest power. It’s thus inconceivable that Facebook would ever dream of deleting this type of actual advocacy or incitement of violence:
Facebook is confronting extreme pressure to censor content disliked by various governments. The U.S. and U.K. have jointly launched a campaign to malign Silicon Valley companies as terrorist helpers or ISIS supporters for refusing to take more active steps to ban content from those whom these governments regard as “terrorists.” Israel has been particularly aggressive in attempting to blame Facebook for violence and coerce it to censor. Family members of Israelis killed by Palestinians are suing Facebook claiming the company helped facilitate those attacks, while some Israelis have actually complained that Facebook is biased against Israel in its censorship practices.
About all of this, The Intercept submitted the following questions to Facebook, which has not yet responded; we will update this article if it does:
1) Has FB ever met with Palestinian leaders in an effort to identify and suppress posts from Israelis that incite violence? Is there any plan to do so?
2) If an Israeli advocates that Palestinians be attacked and/or bombed, would those posts violate FB’s terms of service and be deleted? Have any ever been?
3) What role, exactly, is the Israeli government playing in helping FB identify content that should be barred?
4) FB said it “granted some 95% of the requests” from Israeli officials to remove content. What percentage of requests from Palestinians to remove content has been accepted?
5) If someone says that Israel’s occupation is illegal and should be resisted using all means, would that be permitted?
It’s true that these companies have the legal right as private actors to censor whatever they want. But that proposition ignores the unprecedented control this small group of corporations now exerts over global communications. That this censorship is within their legal rights does not obviate the serious danger this corporate conduct poses, for reasons I set forth here in describing how vast their influence has become in shaping our discourse (see here for a disturbing story today on how Twitter banned a Scottish pro-independence group after it criticized an article from a tabloid journalist, who then complained she was being “harassed”).
It’s not an exaggeration to say that Facebook, at this point, is far and away the most dominant force in journalism. It is indescribably significant to see it work with a government to censor the speech of that government’s opponents. But as is so often the case with censorship, people are content with its application until it is used to suppress views they agree with or like.
One of the early promises of the internet, a key potential benefit, was its ability to equalize disparities, to enable the powerless to communicate as freely and potently as the powerful, and to politically organize in far more efficient ways. Those who continually call on companies such as Facebook and Twitter to censor content are seriously jeopardizing those values, no matter how noble their motives might be. It is difficult to imagine any scenario more at odds with the internet’s promise than Facebook executives and the Israeli government meeting to decide what Palestinians will and will not be allowed to say.",Glenn Greenwald,2016-09-12,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/house-intelligence-committee-to-discuss-classified-report-on-snowden-ahead-of-movie-launch/,House Intelligence Committee to Discuss Classified Report on Snowden Ahead of Movie Launch,"The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will meet this Thursday to discuss former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who in 2013 gave journalists a massive cache of classified documents detailing the U.S. global surveillance regime.
The intelligence oversight panel will be discussing a report prepared by members and staff concerning Snowden’s unauthorized disclosures, according to Jack Langer, director of communications for Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif.,
The report is the product of “around two years” of work, he told The Intercept. While Langer noted that the report is classified, he said the committee might publish an unclassified executive summary — though there aren’t any specific plans yet for its release, or to hold public hearings about its contents.
When asked whether the timing of report had anything to do with talk of Snowden’s return to the United States — to be pardoned or to face trial — Langer said the two events were unrelated.
The American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and prominent activists are launching a campaign Wednesday to urge President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden. The announcement is expected to take place at an event in New York, where Snowden will speak via live stream from Moscow.
However, the congressional meeting also closely coincides with another Snowden related event — the public debut of Oliver Stone’s Snowden film. Langer did not respond to a request for comment on whether the committee would be discussing the movie, which is scheduled for release September 16.
In 2014, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, alleged that Russian intelligence might have helped Snowden to both escape U.S. prosecution and disclose the trove of documents. He offered no evidence to back up these claims, however.
Snowden has from the start maintained he had no intention to stay in Russia, and did not bring any of the leaked materials with him there. It’s unclear if the committee will include possible connections to Russia in its investigation.",Jenna McLaughlin,2016-09-12,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/donald-trump-after-blasting-iraq-war-picks-top-iraq-hawk-as-security-adviser/,"Donald Trump, After Blasting Iraq War, Picks Top Iraq Hawk as Security Adviser","Donald Trump named former CIA director and extremist neoconservative James Woolsey his senior adviser on national security issues on Monday. Woolsey, who left the CIA in 1995, went on to become one of Washington’s most outspoken promoters of U.S. war in Iraq and the Middle East.
As such, Woolsey’s selection either clashes with Trump’s noninterventionist rhetoric — or represents a pivot towards a more muscular, neoconservative approach to resolving international conflicts.
Trump has called the Iraq War “a disaster.”
Woolsey, by contrast, was a key member of the Project for the New American Century — a neoconservative think tank largely founded to encourage a second war with Iraq. Woolsey signed a letter in 1998 calling on Clinton to depose Saddam Hussein and only hours after the 9/11 attacks appeared on CNN and blamed the attacks on Iraq. Woolsey has continued to insist on such a connection despite the complete lack of evidence to support his argument. He also blames Iran.
Weeks before the invasion of Iraq, Woolsey called for broader war in the Middle East, saying “World War IV” was already underway.
Woolsey has also put himself in a position to profit from the wars he has promoted. He has served as vice president of Pentagon contracting giant Booz Allen, and as chairman of Paladin Capital Group, a private equity fund that invests in national security and cybersecurity.
He chairs the leadership council at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish national security nonprofit, and is a venture partner with Lux Capital Management, which invests in emerging technologies like drones, satellite imaging, and artificial intelligence.
Woolsey went on CNN on Monday and said that he was principally motivated to support Trump because of his plans to expand U.S. military spending.
Trump gave a speech last week in which he proposed dramatic expansions of the Army and Marines, and hundred-billion-dollar weapons systems for the Navy and Air Force. He offered no justification — aside from citing a few officials who claimed they wanted more firepower.
Woolsey stood by Trump’s proposal on Monday.
“I think the problem is her budget,” Woolsey said of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton. “She is spending so much money on domestic programs — including ones that we don’t even have now, and the ones we have now are underfunded — I think there can be very little room for the improvements in defense and intelligence that have to be made.”
Woolsey has previously called for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to be “hanged by the neck until he’s dead, rather than merely electrocuted.”
In the past, Woolsey has publicly disagreed with Trump on a number of national security issues — including Trump’s plan to ban Muslim immigration. On Monday, Woolsey told CNN that such a plan would raise First Amendment issues, but that he supported a temporary immigration block from certain Muslim countries.
Thus far, at least, most prominent war hawks have found they had more in common with Clinton than Trump. “I would say all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump,” leading neoconservative Robert Kagan told a group in July.",Alex Emmons; Naomi LaChance,2016-09-12,success

It is a strenuous, unceasing effort to cope with the ordeal of being incarcerated at a federal prison. I find myself identifying with the title character from Shakespeare’s “Richard II” when he laments his own effort to adjust to confinement by wondering, “I have been studying how I may compare this prison where I live unto the world.” I do my best to resist the thought that prison is a reflection of our society, but the comparisons are unavoidable. Unlike “Richard II,” my “studying” has not been so much a comparison as an unhappy realization.
From the moment I crossed the threshold from freedom to incarceration because I was charged with, and a jury convicted me of, leaking classified information to a New York Times reporter, I needed no reminder that I was no longer an individual. Prison, with its “one size fits all” structure, is not set up to recognize a person’s worth; the emphasis is removal and categorization. Inmates are not people; we are our offenses. In this particular prison where I live, there are S-Os (sex offenders), Cho-Mos (child molesters), and gun and drug offenders, among others. Considering the charges and conviction that brought me here, I’m not exactly sure to which category I belong. No matter. There is an overriding category to which I do belong, and it is this prison reality that I sadly “compare unto the world”: I’m not just an inmate, I’m a black inmate.
Thinking that you know about something and actually experiencing it are completely different. Previously, my window into prison life was informed, in part, by the same depictions in movies, TV shows, and books that the rest of America has seen. And unfortunately, as a child I heard firsthand so many stories about prison life from people I knew that it seemed commonplace. I expected there to be a separation of the races — by some accounts “necessary” racial segregation — because that is what I saw, read, and heard. My expectations and naiveté could not prepare me for actually living in it, however.
I didn’t have to be taught the rules of prison society, particularly in regard to racial segregation, because they are so ingrained in just about every aspect of prison society that they seem instinctual. Even though there is no official mandate, here, I am my skin color. Whenever, in my stubborn idealism, I refuse to acknowledge being racially categorized and question the submission to it, the other prisoners invariably respond, “Man, this is prison.”
These distinctions are maintained even when I’m watching TV, because there is no integrated TV watching in prison. I am not welcome to watch in the “white,” “Hispanic,” or “Native” TV rooms. So I spend a lot of time in the black TV room. There are no spatial advantages or disadvantages to this segregation, because all the rooms have one or two tables, one or two TVs that offer the same channels, and the occasional pigeon flitting about indoors.
For me, the black TV room is a place of solace for reading, writing, being frustrated by Sudoku, and generally escaping from the everyday pain of prison life. However, even as an escape, its very existence constantly reminds me of the pervasiveness, pointlessness, and harmfulness of separation along racial lines. It is a reflection of America outside these walls. What I see in prison is sad, but what I’m seeing from prison is worse.
Since arriving here last June, and from the black TV room, I have seen news reports on the racially motivated shooting of black parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, and seemingly unending and routine instances of black citizens, including Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana, falling victim to excessive force and being killed by law enforcement officers. I have also seen reports of law enforcement officers being killed in attacks no less horrific. The sadness I feel at what has been happening outside these walls was already festering inside me before I became an inmate; when I entered prison, I was still reeling from the death of Michael Brown in the St. Louis area, which I proudly call home.
Watching these tragedies from prison, and especially from the black TV room, has been a profound experience. Throughout the days when the shootings were being covered and commentary on the news channels was ongoing, both TVs in the black TV room were constantly tuned in. As the events were unfolding on the news, I was struck by the uncommon silence in the TV room. Accentuating the uneasy silence was an air of frustration and a palpable lack of surprise and shock not only from the others, but also from myself. I, for one, did not know what to say. And that silence was impacted by another burning question I had no answer for, especially being in prison: What am I, or anyone else here, to do? A possible answer came in the form of a comment from one of my fellow viewers that was as stark in breaking the silence as it was in defining where I was and what I was seeing. “Man, this is America,” he said.
I cannot and will not accept that viewpoint, so I wanted and needed to know that outside the black TV room and outside the prison walls, the rest of America also found it unacceptable. I ventured out to see how the news was playing out in the other TV rooms. With the pretext of going to the ice machine (funny how we can’t watch TV together, but we can use the same ice machine), I passed by the white TV room. Those TVs were not tuned to the news reports of the shootings. Instead, one was playing ESPN, the other COPS. I didn’t make it into the Hispanic or Native TV rooms, but it became clear that the America of the white TV room, at least, was not the same as the one that was playing out in the black TV room, both on and off the screen.
Comparing prison unto the world has been no more complex than comparing one TV room to another. The black TV room and the prison society that allows and perpetuates it have not been providing me with a window to America — they have provided a lamentable mirror. That mirror is reflecting the reality that racial segregation, particularly tacitly, is all too American. The America one sees and experiences depends on what TV room the color of one’s skin mandates.
In prison, I see that mindset of latent and allowable racism creating and being typified by racial segregation. On TV, I see that very same mindset in tragic action outside the prison walls through the use of racial profiling throughout the country, racially motivated voter ID laws, politicians stoking racial anxieties for votes, a criminal justice system that engages in racially disparate application and enforcement of the law, and much more. Such all-too-American, misguided practices foster, if not encourage, societal segregation and incite the dangers that necessarily accompany it. I can argue that the Charleston church shooter, the white law enforcement officers who have killed black citizens, and the black men who have killed law enforcement officers acted out of an animosity fueled by this same sort of prison mindset. What I have seen of the America I was a part of is the unfortunate and natural extension of what I’m living in prison.
Call me naive, call me a dreamer, and I’ll wear those monikers proudly because I still believe, even from prison, in this country and what it is supposed to stand for. Has that been my personal experience and what I’ve been seeing from prison? No. As merely one example, during my time in the CIA it became clear, in the organization’s words and actions toward me, that they saw me not as an American who wanted to serve his country but as “a big black guy.” But my dreams of America are far more enduring than a prison TV room mentality. There is a black America, there is a white America, there are many Americas. The greatness and promise of this country lies in equality reinforced by our differences rather than defined by them. My America is not a prison. For now, I’m confined to the black TV room at the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado. When I am free, I don’t want to feel that I’m merely going from one prison to another.",Jeffrey Sterling,2016-09-13,success

— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) August 21, 2016
Clinton operatives and their media supporters have cast criticism of Clinton Foundation practices as indicative of a double standard and complained that allegations of unethical conduct unfairly tarnish an otherwise sterling charitable enterprise. The level of transparency the foundation has imposed on itself is “unprecedented,” Clinton loyalists frequently insist.
It’s true that the volume of criticism over the Clintons’ close relationship with Saudi financiers has been substantial, including a recent front-page story in the New York Times. But this is not evidence of any anti-Clinton conspiracy — it’s common sense. And the Bushes faced similar allegations.
So I decided to take Fallon up on his challenge. There are plenty of examples.
In a May 2002 column lambasting George W.’s foreign policy acumen, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd mocked the elder Bush’s acceptance of Saudi largesse: “The Bush presidential library was built in part with millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,” she wrote.
In September 2003, the American Prospect, a leading liberal policy journal, cited “the Saudi bankrolling of Poppy’s presidential library” as evidence of a sinister linkage between “the House of Bush and the House of Saud,” and intimated that the opaque connections between the two families undermined U.S. credibility on the world stage. The author, Michael Steinberger, recommended that Democrats exploit this vulnerability in the forthcoming 2004 presidential election. (John Kerry later heeded Steinberger’s call.)
The liberal Center for American Progress think tank issued a report in 2004 entitled “The Complete Saudi Primer,” which detailed all the multitudes of ways in which the Bushes’ Saudi dealings — including then-Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Prince Bandar bin Sultan’s $1 million donation to the Bush Library — were indicative of nefarious collusion. The founder and president of the organization at the time of the report’s publication was John Podesta, the current chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
In March 2002, the late journalist Robert Novak disclosed in the Chicago Sun-Times that Bill Clinton had journeyed to Saudi Arabia to deliver a speech for which he was compensated $750,000. Novak noted that the Saudis had also extended financial support to the Bush Family, by way of a donation to the senior George’s library fund.
A May 2003 cover story in The Atlantic by Robert Baer described the many ways in which Saudi Arabia had allegedly exerted undue influence on the Bush administration and noted: “For good measure [Bandar] also contributed a million dollars to the construction of the Bush Presidential Library, in College Station, Texas.”
Then there was the October 2003 feature in Vanity Fair, “Saving the Saudis,” by Craig Unger, which argued that the extensive personal and financial ties between the Bush clan and various Saudi tycoons likely influenced George W. to take preferential government action on behalf of his foreign benefactors — the most notorious example being when members of the royal family were permitted to board a private plane and flee the United States two days after 9/11, even as all other air traffic had been grounded. The Saudis had “contributed to every presidential library built in the past 30 years,” Unger wrote.
Reporting from Unger’s article (and book) served as source material for a major part of Michael Moore’s 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, the highest-grossing documentary of all time.
So, Brian, are these examples satisfactory? Do you agree now that this is a legitimate concern – not simply an unmerited attack by mean-spirited journalists? And are you ready to address whether or not the Clintons are unduly beholden to the Saudis?
That’s not a rhetorical question. For instance, irrespective of any explicit quid pro quo, the Saudis have won tacit acquiescence from Clinton for their military campaign in Yemen, which has caused what is arguably the worst current humanitarian crisis in the world. Using U.S.-provided weaponry, Saudi forces have bombed schools, factories, and hospitals, killing scores of civilians including many children. Vast swaths of the population are now deprived of basic living amenities. Critical infrastructure has been destroyed, preventing the transport of needed goods.
But even though the conflict has been raging since March 2015, Clinton has offered no critical words in public. At a campaign event on June 1, I asked directly for her view on the Saudi incursion — twice. She ignored the question. To this day, her website contains no discussion of the ongoing bombardment. The topic did not come up during last week’s “Commander-in-Chief Forum” on NBC.
By contrast, Donald Trump in August appeared to criticize U.S. involvement with the Saudis in Yemen, although his comments were garbled and only semi-coherent.",Michael Tracey,2016-09-13,success

On July 4, former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw emailed former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to discuss the upcoming release of the Chilcot report — a document detailing the British government’s inquiry. The report probed, among other things, the depth of private British commitment and support for the American-led war in Iraq.
In anticipation of coming press coverage, Straw asked Powell to review a statement in a Word document he drafted. He wrote that the “only silver lining of the Brexit vote is that it will reduce medium term attention on Chilcot — though it will not stop the day of publication being uncomfortable.”
Powell told Straw he should also share the statement with Condoleezza Rice and that he would contact Richard Armitage — two other Bush-era officials who were involved in planning and executing the war.
He showed skepticism toward a part of Straw’s statement that claimed that an additional United Nations resolution prior to the conflict would have avoided the invasion. He wrote back to Straw, “I can’t agree or disagree with your judgement that a second resolution would have prevented conflict. I doubt it, but I don’t know.” (In Straw’s final statement released to the press, the claim remained.)
Nearly a month later, on August 3, Powell emailed Straw to tell him that the Chilcot report “didn’t amount to anything over here” and that he assumed the inquiry simply “faded away.”
“Yes, the Chilcot story has faded altogether here too. It was unpleasant on the day but almost all the focus was on Tony [Blair],” Straw wrote back. He noted that “there is some stuff about some relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq trying to get a legal action against Tony on its feet buy [sic] it’s hard to see how that could work.”
He quickly switched topics, asking Powell if he was coming to London anytime soon. “I met someone recently who had heard you speak and thought you were a wow,” Straw boasted.

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/13/more-proof-the-u-s-national-anthem-has-always-been-tainted-with-racism/,More Proof the U.S. National Anthem Has Always Been Tainted With Racism,"The decision of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to sit during the pregame playing of the national anthem has had a larger impact than anyone could have foreseen.
President Obama has weighed in, endorsing Kaepernick’s “constitutional right to make a statement.” When Kaepernick changed his protest to kneeling instead of sitting, teammate Eric Reid joined him. Brandon Marshall of the Denver Broncos followed suit and lost an endorsement deal. Marcus Peters of the Kansas City Chiefs raised a fist during the anthem, a la John Carlos and Tommy Smith at the 1968 Olympics. An unidentified Navy sailor who took a seat in solidarity with Kaepernick may face disciplinary action. The protest has even spread to high school players across the country.
Much of the debate generated by Kaepernick has been on subjects directly connected to his actions: police brutality, free speech, and the rights and obligations of professional athletes.
But it’s also sparked nationwide discussion of something more tangential that no one saw coming — the meaning and history of “The Star-Spangled Banner” itself, including whether it should be rewritten or replaced entirely.
The very fact this controversy was surprising may be the most significant thing about it. It’s the clearest demonstration possible that even in 2016, the U.S. has barely begun dragging the unflattering aspects of its past out into the light. Part of that means facing the reality that everything about “The Star-Spangled Banner” — its lyrics, its author, and the path it took to becoming the national anthem — is inextricably bound up with America’s gruesome history of racism.
The Meaning of “The Hireling and Slave”
It took 117 years from the time “The Star-Spangled Banner” was written in 1814 until it was legally enshrined as the American national anthem in 1931.
Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that became the song’s lyrics on Sept. 14, 1814, after witnessing the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore during the (poorly named) War of 1812. As The Intercept recently noted, Key’s little-known third stanza includes these lines:
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
By the time Key wrote these words, the British military included a regiment of former slaves called the Colonial Marines, whom the British had encouraged to escape and then trained and armed.
In fact, just weeks before, on Aug. 24, 1814, the Colonial Marines had participated in the Battle of Bladensburg outside Washington, D.C. The Bladensburg fight was a quick, embarrassing defeat for American troops — something Key knew because he’d witnessed it up close as a volunteer aide to a U.S. general. The British forces, including the Colonial Marines, had then continued to Washington the same day, infamously occupying and torching the White House.
The Intercept stated that “slave” referred to these Colonial Marines. However, an enormous number of readers argued that this identification was incorrect, and that Key did not literally mean escaped slaves.
Many such commenters cited an obscure website that describes itself as “history for kids” and states that “slave” refers to U.S. sailors who had been seized and press-ganged into the British navy. (The impressment of Americans was a central grievance cited by the U.S in the lead-up to war.) Others suggested that small-r republican rhetoric from the era often referred to any subjects of a monarch as slaves, and hence the word simply signified all the British.
Key himself never explained precisely what he meant by the third stanza. According to Marc Leepson, author of a recent biography of Key, Key spoke about “The Star-Spangled Banner” in public just once and did not mention this issue. Key did not write about the song in his surviving letters.
That said, Leepson explains, while researching his book he “did not find any historians who interpreted the ‘hireling and slave’ line as anything but a reference to the enslaved people who escaped their bonds and went over to the British side.” Leepson himself also believes it is “clear” this is the correct way to interpret the stanza.
Among the academic experts with this perspective is Alan Taylor, a University of Virginia professor and one of the foremost contemporary scholars of early U.S. history. Two of Taylor’s books have won the Pulitzer Prize; one of these, “The Internal Enemy,” addresses the song’s third stanza, calling it “Key’s dig at the British for employing Colonial Marines.”
In response to questions, Taylor pointed out that it “makes no sense” to believe that Key was referring to impressed U.S. sailors: “American rhetoric of the time cast the impressed sailors as defiant and unbroken by British might — as the exact opposite of the slave.” Moreover, Key certainly would not be celebrating the deaths of Americans held by the British.
Other academic historians with this view include Gene Allen Smith, a specialist in early American and American naval history and author of “The Slaves’ Gamble: Choosing Sides in the War of 1812”; David Reedier; Marc Wayne Kruman; and John Belohlavek. Even Marc Clague, a musicologist and co-founder of the Star Spangled Music Foundation, who strongly defends the song overall, agrees that by “slave” Key meant the Colonial Marines.
By the mid-1800s, the phrase “hireling and slave” could be found in the writing of slavery’s supporters to differentiate between wage laborers and those in actual bondage. Whether this usage was adopted from “The Star-Spangled Banner” or the other way around is unclear, but William Grayson, a U.S. representative from South Carolina, even titled a famed 1855 pro-slavery poem “The Hireling and the Slave.” Grayson contended that slavery had been a “blessing” for Africans and was morally superior to a system of wage work. Grayson also described whites using a new term he had coined: a “master race.”
“I Bought an Old Woman and a Little Girl”
Francis Scott Key could be called the most unknown famous person in U.S. history. A look at his rarely examined life makes clear how difficult it is to separate the national anthem’s meaning from its author, and his gross hypocrisy on the meaning of freedom.
Key was born in 1779 on his wealthy family’s Maryland plantation, known as Terra Rubra. After childhood he left to study law and eventually moved to Washington, D.C., where he kept one or two slaves as servants. In 1813, the year before the British attack on Fort McHenry, Key wrote to his father to inform him that he had just purchased “an old woman and a little girl about 12 or 18 years old.” Key offered to send them to his parents to work on their plantation and apparently did so; in a subsequent letter he asked his mother “how you like the old woman and the girl.”
Upon his father’s death, Key inherited Terra Rubra and its coerced workforce. Key was not physically cruel as a master and during his lifetime freed seven of his household’s slaves. (One, Clem Johnson, had been the plantation’s assistant estate manager. Johnson subsequently stayed at Terra Rubra to help oversee Key’s property, both land and humans.)
Moreover, as Key’s biographer Leepson explains, Key “strongly opposed international slave trafficking on humanitarian grounds, and defended enslaved people and free blacks without charge in the D.C. courts. If you cherry-picked his words on slavery, you might think he was an abolitionist.”
That, however, would be almost 180 degrees from the truth.
In his work, Key was the prototypical Washington lobbyist. In the 1820s, he parlayed his celebrity as patriotic poet into a lucrative law practice helping clients with business before the federal government. During this period, Key also represented slaveholders attempting to retrieve their escaped “property.” In time, Key became a confidant to President Andrew Jackson. He was, in today’s parlance, a Washington insider.
When Jackson appointed Key to serve as district attorney for Washington in 1833, it was not least to enforce the law controlling African-Americans, both those enslaved and the city’s growing population of free blacks. During Key’s seven years in office he proved an energetic and moralistic prosecutor, taking on the dangers of fornication and abolitionism with equal fervor.
In 1833, Key tried to shut down the capital’s “bawdy houses,” the popular female-run brothels that served both white and black customers. (A glance at 20-plus pages of “escort” advertisements in today’s D.C. Yellow Pages indicates that Key failed to stamp out sex work in Washington.) The same year, Key indicted John Prout, a free, black school teacher who had forged papers for a young enslaved couple attempting to escape to freedom. Prout was convicted and was forced to leave town.
The next year, Key ignored the First Amendment to persecute Ben Lundy, a courageous editor who published an anti-slavery newspaper in the capital. Lundy and his assistant editor, the young but soon-to-be famous William Lloyd Garrison, also had to flee Washington, lest they be assaulted by slavers.
Key, like many U.S. politicians after him, was a stickler for “law and order.” Blacks who encountered the constables serving Key often ended up robbed or dead. When a white riot swept the city in August 1835, Key sought to quell fears of a slave rebellion by seeking the death penalty for Arthur Bowen, a young black man accused of attempted murder. When doubts arose about Bowen’s guilt, District Attorney Key was implacable in seeking to hang him. (This perilous battle is recounted in more detail in the book “Snow-Storm in August” by this article’s co-author.)
Key next prosecuted a New York doctor who had moved to Washington with a trunk of anti-slavery literature. The trial attracted attention across the nation. In the courtroom, Key emotionally denounced the abolitionists who wanted to free all enslaved people.
They “declare that every law which sanctions slavery is null and void, and that obedience to it is a sin,” Key declaimed. “That we have no more rights over our slaves than they have over us. Does not this bring the Constitution and the laws under which we live into contempt? Is it not a plain invitation to resist them?”
The American Anti-Slavery Society responded by mocking Key’s most famous words. In an 1836 broadsheet distributed nationwide, the abolitionists detailed the atrocities of human trafficking in the U.S. capital under the headline “Land of the Free/Home of the Oppressed.” If Twitter had existed in the 1830s, that likely would have become a trending hashtag: #HomeOfTheOppressed.
Seen through the prism of Key’s life, then, the significance of his words about the “land of the free” comes into focus. For Key, freedom was never a promise available to everyone; white freedom and white lives were what mattered.
“A Monstrous Perversion”
The popularity of “The Star-Spangled Banner” grew continuously in the decades after Key wrote the lyrics. By the time of the Civil War, some on both sides tried to claim it as their own.
Tellingly, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. felt that if the song were to belong to the North, it would need a new stanza — one he provided, invoking “the millions unchained who our birthright have gained.” By contrast, supporters in the South did not believe it required any changes. “Let us never surrender to the North the noble song, the ‘Star-Spangled Banner,’” the Richmond Examiner editorialized in 1861 in the capital of the Confederacy. “It is Southern in origin, in sentiments, in poetry, and song. In its association with chivalrous deeds, it is ours.”
In the subsequent decades, “The Star-Spangled Banner” continued to be contested territory and the subject of what we’d now term a culture war. By the early 1900s, versions of the song that included Holmes’s words were found in schoolbooks in New York, Indiana, Louisiana, and elsewhere.
When Confederate veterans realized this, they quickly organized to force state governments, including that of New York, to withdraw the textbooks. The New York Times declared that Holmes’s words were a “monstrous perversion” and Holmes himself was a “presumptuous ass.” (The extra stanza has since largely evaporated and is not part of the anthem’s official lyrics.)
The skirmishing continued after the carnage of World War I, as momentum grew for the U.S. to adopt a formal national anthem. Pacifists denounced “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a war-mongering, anti-British jingle. A progressive heiress took out an anti-Banner ad in several newspapers, and several Columbia University professors announced a contest for a more suitable replacement.
On the other side, Maryland Rep. John Linthicum, the Daughters of the Confederacy, and other Southern civic organizations declared that the song was the essence of American patriotism.
By the 1920s, the battle lines were clear. Those who wanted to celebrate the post-Civil War unity of North and South without reference to the abolition of slavery favored “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Many Northerners preferred the emancipationist spirit of “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” or the stately grandeur of “America the Beautiful.” African-Americans had their own ideas, and in 1926 adopted “Lift Every Voice” by Florida poet James Weldon Johnson as a black national anthem.
In 1931 there was finally a clear winner: Congress approved, and President Herbert Hoover signed, Rep. Linthicum’s bill making “The Star-Spangled Banner” America’s one and only national anthem.
Controversy ensued within 48 hours. Partisans of the Banner held a parade in Linthicum’s Baltimore district, led by two color guards: one hoisting the American flag, the other carrying the Confederate flag.
The Union Army veterans marching in the parade dropped out and denounced the damned rebels for hijacking the proceedings. In response, one neo-Confederate woman — in what sounds like an indignant Facebook post from this year — accused the offended Union veterans of being un-American and “divisive.”
“History Could Be Swallowed Up So Completely”
The suppression of history embodied by “The Star-Spangled Banner” is by no means unique to the U.S. On the contrary, it’s universal: The most important and painful realities of any society’s past tend to be forgotten unless constant efforts are made to remember them.
Intriguingly, one of the most eloquent descriptions of this phenomenon is found in Barack Obama’s autobiography, “Dreams From My Father.”
In 1967, when Obama was 6, he and his mother joined his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, in Indonesia — just two years after one of the most astonishing bloodbaths of the 20th century had taken place there. Suharto, an Indonesian general, had seized power in 1965 and with U.S. support massacred at least 500,000 leftists and communists over just a few months.
Yet on the surface, Obama writes, there was little sign of this. His stepfather refused to speak of the past, and his mother learned of it only from “innuendo” and “half-whispered asides” from Americans when she went to work at the U.S. Embassy. According to Obama, this is the lesson she took from this:
The idea frightened her, the notion that history could be swallowed up so completely, the same way the rich and loamy earth could soak up the rivers of blood that had once coursed through the streets; the way people could continue about their business … as if nothing had happened. …
Power. The word fixed in my mother’s mind like a curse. In America, it had generally remained hidden from view until you dug beneath the surface of things; until you visited an Indian reservation or spoke to a black person whose trust you had earned. But here power was undisguised, indiscriminate, naked. … And so Lolo had made his peace with power, learned the wisdom of forgetting.
Americans today are fortunate that the penalties for remembering our past, while real, are much less severe than in many other times and places. If we truly aspire to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, we should be able to examine the real history of “The Star-Spangled Banner” — and most importantly, the degree to which that history is still alive today. Our current difficulty in facing our past honestly and soberly strongly suggests that we are still a long way from laying it to rest.",Jefferson Morley; Jon Schwarz,2016-09-13,success

https://theintercept.com/2016/09/14/beer-pot-ballot/,Alcohol Industry Bankrolls Fight Against Legal Pot in Battle of the Buzz,"The fight against legalized pot is being heavily bankrolled by alcohol and pharmaceutical companies, terrified that they might lose market share.
On the heels of a filing last week that revealed that a synthetic cannabis company is financing the opposition to legal marijuana in Arizona comes a new disclosure this week that a beer industry group made one of the largest donations to an organization set up to defeat legalization in Massachusetts.
The Beer Distributors PAC, an affiliate that represents 16 beer-distribution companies in Massachusetts, gave $25,000 to the Campaign for a Safe and Healthy Massachusetts, tying it for third place among the largest contributors to the anti-pot organization.
William A. Kelley, the president of the Beer Distributors of Massachusetts, did not respond to a request for comment, but his organization’s decision to oppose legalization is hardly unique in the alcohol industry.
In Arizona, one of the five states with marijuana legalization ballot measures this November, the Arizona Wine and Spirits Wholesale Association donated $10,000 to a group opposing legalization. In 2010, the last time California considered marijuana legalization, another alcoholic beverage distribution group provided financing to a law enforcement-backed campaign to defeat legalization.
The alcohol industry is nowhere near unified over pot policy, however, with several craft brewing firm welcoming laws that relax restrictions over pot.
Securities and Exchange Commission filings reveal that heavyweight alcohol companies have disclosed to investors that pot could pose a challenge to their bottom line.
The Boston Beer Company, the parent company of Sam Adams, told investors in its 10-K filing that laws that allow the “sale and distribution of marijuana” could “adversely impact the demand” for beer.
The Brown-Forman Company, maker of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Finlandia Vodka, similarly warned in its 10-K filing that “consumer preferences and purchases may shift due to a host of factors, many of which are difficult to predict, including … the potential legalization of marijuana use on a more widespread basis within the United States, and changes in travel, leisure, dining, gifting, entertaining, and beverage consumption trends.”
Research about the impact of marijuana legalization on consumer habits is split. Daniel Rees, a professor of economics at the University of Colorado, Denver, has claimed that consumers will substitute marijuana for alcohol when given the chance. But tax revenue in Colorado, which legalized pot in 2012, suggests consumers have continued to purchase alcohol at almost the same rate as before legalization.
Paul Varga, the chief executive of Brown-Forman, told investors during an earnings call in August 2014 that marijuana legalization was emerging as a “big threat.” But four months later, in another discussion with investors, Varga backpedaled a bit. “I wouldn’t say I’m losing sleep over the legalization of marijuana,” he noted. “But I’m paying attention to it.”",Lee Fang,2016-09-14,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/14/chelsea-manning-ends-hunger-strike-will-get-gender-reassignment-surgery/,"Chelsea Manning Ends Hunger Strike, Will Get Gender Affirming Surgery","U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning will receive gender affirming surgery, and is ending her hunger strike after five days, her lawyers have confirmed.
“I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right thing,” Manning said in a statement. “I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted — for them to let me be me. But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long.”
Until her surgery, the military will still require Manning to keep her hair short.
Manning’s psychologist formally recommended surgery in April 2016. Despite recommendations dating back to 2014 that she be allowed to grow her hair out, the military has not allowed her to do so.
Since her arrest in 2010, Manning has suffered numerous abuses, including being forced to strip naked, prolonged solitary confinement, disciplinary charges for such things as having expired toothpaste in her cell, and being denied medical care.
Manning still faces a hearing on Sept. 20 concerning charges related to her suicide attempt.
Manning’s struggle to obtain medical care mirrors the struggle of transgender inmates nationwide. Despite major medical associations recognizing reassignment surgery as necessary medical care for gender dysphoria, no transgender prisoner has ever received gender reassignment surgery in a U.S. prison, according to the ACLU.
Chase Strangio, Manning’s lawyer with the ACLU, issued the following statement: “This is a monumental day for Chelsea, who can now enjoy some peace knowing that critically needed medical care is forthcoming. This medical care is absolutely vital for Chelsea as it is for so many transgender people — in and out of prison — who are systemically denied treatment solely because they are transgender. Thankfully the government has recognized its constitutional obligation to provide Chelsea with the medical care that she needs and we hope that they will act without delay to ensure that her suffering does not needlessly continue.”",Alex Emmons,2016-09-14,success
https://theintercept.com/2016/09/14/paulinho-da-forca-no-controle-da-reforma-agraria/,Paulinho da Força no controle da Reforma Agrária | Intercept Brasil,"Uma das mudanças mais interessantes a serem observadas no governo de Michel Temer envolve a atuação do Incra, órgão responsável pela reforma agrária no país. Entre outros fatores, pelo fato de Dilma Rousseff ter feito um trabalho bastante ruim numa área em que o ex-presidente Lula e o próprio PT cultivaram por mais de duas décadas uma de suas principais bases de sustentação no campo social. Embora não tenha sido decisivo para seu destino político, é fato que Dilma perdeu esse capital de apoio. O MST não foi às ruas defender seu mandato de maneira significativa. E, agora, com Temer? Qual será o papel desempenhado pelo Incra?
O Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária tem como função essencial redistribuir as terras do Brasil, acabando com grandes propriedades de terra improdutivas, dividir essas porções em lotes e entregá-los para famílias que dependem do campo e buscam condições básicas para plantar.
A gerência política dessa área do governo Temer foi entregue, após uma negociação sem contratempos, a Paulo Pereira da Silva, líder há 22 anos ininterruptos da Força Sindical, o segundo maior grupo de sindicatos do país e a principal apoiadora da ascensão de Michel Temer ao poder entre representantes de trabalhadores. Paulinho foi uma das primeiras e principais vozes dentro da Câmara a favor do impeachment de Dilma Rousseff. É ele quem dá o aval para nomeações dentro do órgão – informalmente, claro, seguindo à risca as regras tácitas da política brasileira.
Algumas coisas chamam a atenção para a entrega do Incra para os desígnios de Paulinho da Força, para além da demonstração clara de que o fisiologismo continua imperando. A primeira é que ele é um sindicalista urbano. A segunda é que, em seus três mandatos como deputado federal, Paulinho jamais apresentou um único projeto relacionado ao assunto da reforma agrária. Ele também nunca integrou uma comissão da Câmara que discutisse projetos relativos ao tema, ou apresentou emendas parlamentares para, por exemplo, beneficiar assentamentos rurais.Apesar dessa distância do tema em sua atuação legislativa, um dos processos aos quais responde na Justiça é justamente por ilegalidades na… reforma agrária. Ele foi condenado em primeira instância pela Justiça Federal por improbidade administrativa por participar, como presidente da Força Sindical, de uma fraude de R$ 3 milhões no Banco da Terra para a compra superavaliada de um terreno inviável para destinação à reforma agrária.
É ele quem apadrinha o novo presidente do Incra, Leonardo Góes Silva, inclusive com notícia exaltando suas qualidades no site do Solidariedade, partido político criado em 2013 por Paulinho. É dele também a indicação de outros dirigentes, incluindo o responsável pelo desenvolvimento de novos projetos de assentamentos, Ewerton Giovanni dos Santos — este filiado ao Solidariedade em Minas Gerais e que advoga para ao menos um fazendeiro no Estado.
Mais que isso, Paulinho bancou a nomeação de seu filho para comandar uma das superintendências regionais mais importantes do país, a de São Paulo. Alexandre Pereira da Silva é, desde o dia 4 de julho, o responsável por questões relativas, entre outras, à luta pela terra na região do Pontal do Paranapanema, próximo à divisa com o Mato Grosso do Sul, uma das mais conflituosas do país.
O que, afinal, quer Paulinho à frente do Incra? Recentemente, a Coluna Esplanada, do UOL, relatou que ele está criando um braço rural para a Força Sindical, com o nome de Força Rural, para ser um contrapeso para o MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem-Terra). Ainda não há nada oficial a respeito, mas a Força Sindical já tem um braço de atuação voltado especificamente para os trabalhadores rurais assalariados — ou seja, aqueles que trabalham no campo para agricultores. Nem CUT, maior central sindical do país, tem uma secretaria com esse perfil.
Apesar de o governo planejar um corte de metade da verba programada para a reforma agrária em 2017, o controle sobre o Incra tem um alto valor. Direcionar a seleção dos beneficiados com novos assentamentos, as verbas para melhorias da estrutura das terras cedidas para a reforma agrária e os mais de R$ 200 milhões que o governo planeja para 2017, para a compra de novos terrenos, pode servir para garantir um bom capital político a ele, à sua central sindical e ao seu partido político entre os hoje sem-terra.
Aliado do agronegócio controla desapropriação de terras
A falta de um compromisso mais claro dos novos dirigentes do Incra com a causa da reforma agrária está presente, também, na nomeação de Luiz Antônio Possas de Carvalho para a Diretoria de Obtenção de Terras e Implantação de Projetos de Assentamentos — cargo que já tinha ocupado por apenas 45 dias no governo Dilma.
Possas de Carvalho, avalizado por Paulinho, é uma indicação pessoal do deputado federal Carlos Bezerra, do PMDB de Mato Grosso. Ele, que agora cuidará de interesses daqueles que querem tirar terras de grandes proprietários rurais, já advogou para importantes fazendeiros e pecuaristas — entre eles, em processo contra o Incra, numa desapropriação de terras da família de Jonas Barcellos Corrêa Filho.
Jonas Barcellos é conhecido como o “rei do gado” brasileiro. É um dos maiores criadores de boi nelore do país e conhecido por seu poder de lobby e alto trânsito entre autoridades da República. Uma de suas marcas é a feijoada que oferece a poderosos em sua fazenda em Uberaba (MG). Está longe de ser um entusiasta da reforma agrária.
Em levantamento feito pelo The Intercept Brasil, considerando somente os casos que tramitam ou tramitaram na Justiça Federal de Mato Grosso, Possas de Carvalho surge como advogado em oito ações contra o Incra, em defesa de proprietários rurais ou grandes empresas agropecuárias. Outro nome conhecido que já foi representado por ele em processo contra o órgão do qual agora é diretor estratégico é Flávio Pentagna Guimarães, presidente do banco BMG.
A gestão do Incra está paralisada …o TCU determinou a paralisação de todos os processos de escolha de novos beneficiários.
Possas de Carvalho já tinha sido pivô de uma operação de barganha política no apagar das luzes do governo de Dilma Rousseff. Ele foi nomeado por Dilma no fim de março deste ano, para o mesmo cargo, com o objetivo de agradar o peemedebista Carlos Bezerra, do Mato Grosso, um dos estados com maior presença do agronegócio, onde 114 pessoas foram ameaçadas de morte e seis delas foram assassinadas entre 2000 e 2010 em disputas por terras, segundo a Comissão Pastoral da Terra.
No entanto, com o voto de Carlos Bezerra a favor da admissibilidade do impeachment, Carvalho foi imediatamente exonerado pela então presidente, recuperando o posto assim que Michel Temer assumiu o governo interino.
A gestão do Incra está paralisada, em grande parte, por força de decisão tomada pelo Tribunal de Contas da União em abril deste ano. Foi encontrada uma gigantesca lista de absurdas irregularidades no órgão, especialmente na seleção de beneficiados para os assentamentos criados pelo instituto. Na decisão, o TCU determinou a paralisação de todos os processos de escolha de novos beneficiários, assim como de qualquer apoio a assentamentos já existentes.
Há dinheiro para terras de grilheiro, mas falta para modernizar o Incra
Mesmo com a decisão que, na prática, congela a criação de novos assentamentos, a área de obtenção de terras seguiu funcionando a pleno vapor. Na sua primeira passagem pela diretoria de obtenção de terras, Possas de Carvalho assumiu oficialmente no dia 28 de março. De janeiro deste ano até aquele dia, o Incra tinha liberado R$ 2,2 milhões para a desapropriação de três terrenos, conforme dados levantados pelo The Intercept Brasil no sistema Siga Brasil, de acompanhamento da execução do Orçamento federal. Nos três dias que se seguiram à posse de Carvalho, foram 16 liberações, num total de R$ 34 milhões. Até o momento em que foi exonerado por Dilma, ele já tinha carimbado R$ 76,4 milhões para essas desapropriações. Depois, quando voltou sob Temer, foram mais R$ 16,8 milhões para proprietários rurais até o fim de julho.
Não se tratam de novos decretos de desapropriação, mas do pagamento desses valores, que costumam rodar anos em ações judiciais de contestações de valores. Entre essas liberações, a maior delas, no valor de R$ 24 milhões, aconteceu no primeiro dia de sua gestão. Foi para garantir a desapropriação da Fazenda Nacional, localizada no município de Água Boa, em Mato Grosso, seu estado. Outras três, num total de R$ 19 milhões, beneficiaram Antonio Martins dos Santos, conhecido no meio rural como “Galo Velho” e apontado como o maior grileiro de terras de Rondônia — onde estão as fazendas pagas pelo Incra.
Atualmente, Antônio Martins dos Santos é um dos alvos de um inquérito sigiloso no STJ por suspeita de falsidade ideológica, falsificação de documentos, corrupção ativa e associação criminosa.
O latifundiário é ligado a Amir Lando, ex-senador que sempre teve ascendência sobre a superintendência do Incra em Rondônia, que, por sua vez, é aliado político de Carlos Bezerra. Ambos fizeram dobradinha no início do governo Lula. Lando era o ministro da Previdência Social, enquanto Bezerra presidia o INSS.
Entre as novas autorizações para desapropriação, em portaria publicada em agosto, o caso com maior valor envolve uma propriedade de uma família de usineiros de Pernambuco. Será comprada por R$ 21 milhões, mas o dinheiro ainda não foi liberado.
O governo quer fazer passar no Congresso um projeto de lei que autoriza a venda de grandes propriedades de terra para estrangeiro
Apesar dessa fartura de liberações de recursos para a compra de terras num contexto nebuloso, há outros detalhes da nova gestão do Incra que chamam a atenção. O novo presidente do órgão, Leonardo Góes Silva, assinou duas resoluções, no último dia 29 de julho. Em uma delas, mandou cancelar, por falta de dinheiro, uma parceria com a UFRJ para “realização de pesquisa voltada à análise da trajetória de desenvolvimento dos assentamentos rurais e o modelo atual de atuação do Incra”, com o objetivo de gerar “subsídios para que o Incra planeje e organize a sua atuação futura no âmbito do Programa Nacional de Reforma Agrária”. A parceria custaria ao Incra pouco mais de R$ 3 milhões. Na outra, também alegando falta de verbas, suspendeu decisão tomada em março deste ano pela gestão anterior, que havia aprovado as “diretrizes gerais, bem como as estimativas orçamentárias do Projeto de Modernização Tecnológica do Incra”.
No horizonte, há ainda mais um ponto que colocará o Incra no centro de uma polêmica. O governo quer fazer passar no Congresso um projeto de lei que autoriza a venda de grandes propriedades de terra para estrangeiros. O texto roda na Câmara desde 2007. Ganhou fôlego no ano passado e, já há alguns meses, está pronto para ser votado em plenário, e com apoio do presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia. O texto não impede que terras ainda não declaradas para fins de reforma agrária pelo Incra sejam vendidas para estrangeiros. Um dono de uma vasta e improdutiva porção de terra pode achar mais negócio fechar um acordo com uma empresa de fora do que esperar a burocracia do governo para receber dinheiro de desapropriação.
Caso o projeto seja aprovado dessa forma, será uma boa forma de verificar o grau de republicanismo do Incra e seus dirigentes, já que uma maior lentidão para produzir laudos e pegar terras para a reforma agrária pode levar as áreas improdutivas atuais a serem vendidas para interessados que há anos esperam a oportunidade de explorar o campo brasileiro.
JÁ ESTÁ ACONTECENDO
Quando o assunto é a ascensão da extrema direita no Brasil, muitos acham que essa é uma preocupação só para anos eleitorais. Mas o projeto de poder bolsonarista nunca dorme.
A grande mídia, o agro, as forças armadas, as megaigrejas e as big techs bilionárias ganharam força nas eleições municipais — e têm uma vantagem enorme para 2026.
Não podemos ficar alheios enquanto somos arrastados para o retrocesso, afogados em fumaça tóxica e privados de direitos básicos. Já passou da hora de agir. Juntos.
A meta ousada do Intercept para 2025 é nada menos que derrotar o golpe em andamento antes que ele conclua sua missão. Para isso, dependemos do apoio de nossos leitores.
