The statute not only applies to organized crime groups but also to individuals and organizations involved in various illicit activities that meet the criteria of the law. RICO allows the government to seize assets obtained from illegal activities and imposes severe penalties, including lengthy prison sentences, fines, and forfeiture of profits associated with racketeering.\n\nThe RICO Act has been applied in various contexts beyond traditional organized crime, including cases involving corporate fraud, political corruption, and various forms of conspiracy, making it a powerful tool for law enforcement agencies in combating broader patterns of unlawful conduct.",

The primary purpose of the RICO Act is to combat organized crime in the United States by allowing for the prosecution of individuals involved in corrupt organizations. \n\nUnder RICO, it is illegal for anyone associated with an enterprise to conduct or participate in the affairs of that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Racketeering activity includes a variety of offenses, such as bribery, extortion, fraud, money laundering, and various forms of theft and violence. \n\nThe act provides both criminal and civil penalties for violations, meaning that offenders can be prosecuted criminally by the government and also sued civilly by private parties. RICO has been used not only against traditional organized crime groups, such as the Mafia, but also in cases involving other types of enterprises, including gangs, corrupt businesses, and even some instances of corporate fraud.\n\nTo establish a RICO violation, prosecutors must prove that the defendant engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity connected to an enterprise, which can be any legal entity or group of individuals associated together for a common purpose. The law's broad scope has resulted in its application in various cases beyond the realm of organized crime, leading to its utilization in political corruption, white-collar crime, and civil rights violations. \n\nOverall, the RICO Act is viewed as a powerful tool in the fight against organized crime and corruption in the United States.",
